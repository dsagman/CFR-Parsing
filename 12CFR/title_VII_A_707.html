</h4>
<p>The annual percentage yield (APY) measures the total amount of dividends a credit union pays on an account based on the dividend rate and the frequency of compounding. The annual percentage yield is expressed as an annualized rate, based on a 365-day year. (Credit unions may calculate the annual percentage yield based on a 365-day or a 366-day year in a leap year.) Part I of this appendix discusses the annual percentage yield calculations for account disclosures and advertisements, while Part II discusses annual percentage yield earned calculations for statements. The annual percentage yield reflects only dividends and does not include the value of any bonus, as that term is defined in part 707, that may be provided to the member to open, maintain, increase or renew an account. Dividends, interest or other earnings are not to be included in the annual percentage yield if such amounts are determined by circumstances that may or may not occur in the future. These formulas apply to both dividend-bearing and interest-bearing accounts held by credit unions. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-707" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-707">Part I. Annual Percentage Yield for Account Disclosures and Advertising Purposes </p>
<p>In general, the annual percentage yield for account disclosures under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.4" class="cfr external">§§ 707.4</a> and <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.5" class="cfr external">707.5</a> and for advertising under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.8" class="cfr external">§ 707.8</a> is an annualized rate that reflects the relationship between the amount of dividends that would be earned by the member for the term of the account and the amount of principal used to calculate those dividends. The amount of dividends that would be earned may be projected based on the most recent past declared rate or an anticipated future rate, whichever the credit union judges to most reasonably approximate the dividends to be earned. Special rules apply to accounts with tiered and stepped dividend rates, and to certain term share accounts with a stated maturity greater than 1 year. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-707(A.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-707 A.">A. General Rules </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Except as provided in Part I. E. of this appendix, the annual percentage yield shall be calculated by the formula shown below. Credit unions may calculate the annual percentage yield using projected dividends based on either the rate at the last dividend declaration date or the rate anticipated at a future date. The credit union must disclose whichever option it uses to members. Credit unions shall calculate the annual percentage yield based on the actual number of days for the term of the account. For accounts without a stated maturity date (such as a typical share or share draft account), the calculation shall be based on an assumed term of 365 days. In determining the total dividends figure to be used in the formula, credit unions shall assume that all principal and dividends remain on deposit for the entire term, and that no other transactions (deposits or withdrawals) occur during the term. (This assumption shall not be used if a credit union requires, as a condition of the account, that members withdraw dividends during the term. In such a case, the dividends (and annual percentage yield calculation) shall reflect that requirement.) For term share accounts that are offered in multiples of months, credit unions may base the number of days on either the actual number of days during the applicable period, or the number of days that would occur for any actual sequence of that many calendar months. If credit unions choose to use this permissive rule, they must use the same number of days to calculate the dollar amount of dividends that will be earned on the account in the annual percentage yield formula (where “Dividends” are divided by “Principal”.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The annual percentage yield is to be calculated by use of the following general formula ((“APY”) is used for convenience in the formulas): </p>

<p>For variable-rate accounts without an introductory premium or discounted rate, a credit union must base the calculation only on the initial dividend rate in effect when the account is opened (or advertised), and assume that this rate will not change during the year. </p>
<p>Variable-rate accounts with an introductory premium or discount rate must be treated like stepped-rate accounts. Thus, a credit union shall assume that: (1) The introductory simple dividend rate is in effect for the length of time provided for in the account contract; and (2) the variable dividend rate that would have been in effect when the account is opened or advertised (but for the introductory rate) is in effect for the remainder of the year. If the variable rate is tied to an index, the index-based rate in effect at the time of disclosure must be used for the remainder of the year. If the rate is not tied to an index, the rate in effect for existing members holding the same account (who are not receiving the introductory dividend rate) must be used for the remainder of the year. </p>
<p>For example, if a credit union offers an account on which it pays a 7% dividend rate, compounded daily, for the first three months (which, for example, contains 91 days), while the variable dividend rate that would have been in effect when the account was opened was 5%, the total dividends for a 365-day year for a $1,000 account balance is $56.52, (based on 91 days at 7% followed by 274 days at 5%).

<p>For accounts in which two or more dividend rates paid on the account are applicable to specified balance levels, the credit union must calculate the annual percentage yield in accordance with the method described below that it uses to calculate dividends. In all cases, an annual percentage yield (or a range of annual percentage yields, if appropriate) must be disclosed for each balance tier. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph">Tiering Method A </p>
<p>Under this method, a credit union pays on the full balance in the account the stated dividend rate that corresponds to the applicable share balance tier. For example, if a member deposits $8,000, the credit union pays the 5.50% dividend rate on the entire $8,000. This is also known as a “hybrid” or “plateau” tiered rate account. </p>
<p>When this method is used to determine dividends, only one annual percentage yield will apply to each tier. Within each tier, the annual percentage yield will not vary with the amount of principal assumed to have been deposited. </p>
<p>For the dividend rates and account balances assumed above, the credit union will state three annual percentage yields—one corresponding to each balance tier. Calculation of each annual percentage yield is similar for this type of account as for accounts with a single fixed dividend rate. Thus, the calculation is based on the total amount of dividends that would be received by the member for each tier of the account for a year and the principal assumed to have been deposited to earn that amount of dividends. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph">Tiering Method B </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Under this method, a credit union pays the stated dividend rate only on that portion of the balance within the specified tier. For example, if a member deposits $8,000, the credit union pays 5.25% on only $2,500 and 5.50% on $5,500 (the difference between $8,000 and the first tier cutoff of $2,500). This is also known as a “pure” tiered rate account. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The credit union that computes dividends in this manner must provide a range that shows the lowest and the highest annual percentage yields for each tier (other than for the first tier, which, like the tiers in Method A, has the same annual percentage yield throughout). The low figure for an annual percentage yield is calculated based on the total amount of dividends earned for a year assuming the <em>minimum</em> principal required to earn the dividend rate for that tier. The high figure for an annual percentage yield is based on the amount of dividends the credit union would pay on the <em>highest</em> principal that could be deposited to earn that same dividend rate. If the account does not have a limit on the amount that can be deposited, the credit union may assume any amount. </p>

<div class="header">General Note:</div>
<p>Appendix B contains model clauses and sample forms intended for optional use by credit unions to aid in compliance with the disclosure requirements of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.4" class="cfr external">§§ 707.4</a> (account disclosures), 707.5 (subsequent disclosures), 707.6 (statement disclosures), and 707.8 (advertisements). Section 269(b) of TISA provides that credit unions that use these clauses and forms will be in compliance with TISA's disclosure provisions.</p>
</div>
<p>As discussed in the supplementary information to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.3#p-707.3(a)" class="cfr external">§ 707.3(a)</a>, this final rule provides for flexibility in designing the format of the disclosures. Credit unions can choose to prepare a single document or brochure that incorporates disclosures for all accounts offered, or to prepare different documents for each type of account. Credit unions may also use inserts to a document, or fill in blanks to show current rates, fees and other terms. </p>
<p>In the model clauses, words in parentheses indicate the type of disclosure a credit union should insert in the space provided (for example, a credit union might insert “July 23, 1995” in the blank for a “(date)” disclosure). Brackets and “/” indicate that a credit union must choose the alternative that best describes its practice (for example, “[daily balance/ average daily balance]”). It should be noted that only in sections B–6 through B–10 of this appendix have specific examples of disclosures been given, with dates and figures. Sections B–1 through B–5, and section B–11 provide only unspecific model clauses or blank forms. The Board felt, as articulated in the appendix A to Regulation DD, that a mix of blank clauses and forms and application of the model clauses to real specific situations would benefit those who must comply with TISA. </p>
<p>Any references to NCUA Rules and Regulations, the <em>NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,</em> or the <em>NCUA Accounting Manual for FCUs,</em> are provided for guidance and as a point of reference for credit unions. Citations to these sources does not indicate that their application is required for those credit unions who need not follow them. </p>
<p>Note also that certain information that appeared in previous versions of the <em>NCUA Accounting Manual for FCUs</em> that served as a model for this appendix do not appear in the current version of that publication. </p>

<p>This provision reflects an accurate statement for an interest-bearing account authorized by state law for state-chartered credit unions. While the definition of the term “interest” permits its substitution for the term “dividends,” separate disclosures should be made for interest-bearing accounts. Since account opening disclosures may be provided to potential members requesting account information before opening an account, and members opening new accounts, information is provided indicating that the rate may not be current, but that the potential member or member may call the credit union to obtain up-to-date information. When opening a new account, of course, a credit union could provide the contractual rate alone, and delete the sentences in brackets. Given the definition of fixed-rate account in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.2#p-707.2(n)" class="cfr external">§ 707.2(n)</a>, credit unions offering fixed-rate accounts must contract to hold rates steady for at least a 30-day period.

<div class="header">Note:</div>
<p>Credit unions may disclose the dividend rate and annual percentage yield on accounts as of the last dividend declaration date. This necessitates inclusion of a disclosure of the actual calendar date of the last dividend declaration date. Additionally or alternatively (if the last dividend rate could be inaccurate), credit unions may disclose a prospective dividend rate and a prospective annual percentage yield. Such prospective rates and yields must be estimated in good faith, and must be declared at the proper time if it is at all possible to do so. As for the last sentence in these disclosures, this provision reflects a credit union policy to set prospective dividend rates for the next month (or at least 30 days), quarter or other period. Many credit unions, at their mid-monthly board meeting, set prospective dividend rates for the next month beginning on the 1st day of the month and continuing to the last day of the month. These rates must be formalized or ratified at the end of a dividend period. Given the timing of the board meetings, the time to prepare and mail notices and the 30 day period, it will often take credit unions 45 to 60 days to effectively change rates. For these reasons, the Board strongly suggests that credit unions do not offer fixed-rate, dividend-bearing accounts.</p>

<p>This form is modeled on NCUA Form FCU 150, Application for Membership, as discussed in the <em>Accounting Manual for FCUs,</em> <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-5030.1" class="cfr external">§§ 5030.1</a>, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-5150.3" class="cfr external">5150.3</a>. It is noted that other information can also be requested on the signature card, as long as it is in accordance with federal and state laws. For example, information identifying the member, such as a state driver's license number, could be added. The types of accounts that the signature applies to could be specified. Furthermore, the Board notes that this card contains much identification information that may not be necessary for all credit unions; common sense should guide credit union boards of directors in designing their applications for membership/signature cards. However, the Board believes that the information solicited on this form is reasonable and prudent for many credit unions. Payable on death designations, joint account language required under state law, life savings beneficiary designations, and other like variations and designations may be added to the card if so desired. The proposed signature card/ application for membership form contained taxpayer certification language. One commenter noted that the IRS may always change its requirements in this area, which are beyond the authority of the Board. Therefore, the Board has deleted reference to the IRS taxpayer certification required by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/26/3406" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">26 U.S.C. 3406</a>, but notes that such certification must be made in accordance with applicable law and IRS rules. The information may be included on the front and back of a standard size signature card, or on the front of a large size signature card. However, no account terms may be included on a signature card unless a copy of the signature card is provided to the member at the time of account opening. The Board recommends that credit unions refrain from this practice, and instead use standard account disclosures. One reason for this is that if laws, regulations or credit union policies change, discrepancies may result between them and the earlier signature card terms. Given the longevity of credit union membership, signature cards may well be in use for up to or over a century. In addition, as signature cards are relatively small, they probably will not contain enough space to make all desired and required disclosures. Fragmentation of terms, some on signature cards, some on separate disclosures, could easily lead to member confusion. As terms are usually construed against the drafter, credit unions should be very careful in their use of account terms and conditions varying from those provided as model clauses and sample forms in this appendix.</p>

It is simplified to reflect the term share (certificate) account agreement, the parties involved, the maturity term and the annual percentage yield and dividend rate. All other terms are incorporated by reference. This should allow the credit union maximum flexibility in fashioning certificate, and other term share account, products. If a credit union so desired, other terms and conditions could be incorporated into the term share certificate itself, as long as a copy is presented to the member at the account opening. Care should also be taken to ensure that the term share certificate format addresses any necessary state law concerns. As the FRB's Regulation D on reserve requirements permits all term share accounts to be represented by a transferable or nontransferable, or a negotiable or nonnegotiable, certificate, instrument, passbook, statement or otherwise, and still be considered a “time deposit”, the Board has made no entry on this sample form regarding such terms, leaving the decision instead to each credit union's board of directors. <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-204.2#p-204.2(c)(2)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 204.2(c)(2)</a>.</p>

<div class="header">Note:</div>
<p>This form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the <em>Accounting Manual for FCUs,</em> <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-5150.7" class="cfr external">§ 5150.7</a>. The disclosures are for a variable-rate, daily balance method dividend calculation regular share account in an FCU with a $500 minimum balance to avoid service fees. For the example, the account was opened on May 1, 1995. Other terms are self-explanatory. The dividend rate paid and annual percentage yield disclosures will reflect the prospective dividend rate for a given dividend period. Item nos. 1–8 reflect standard TISA and part 707 disclosures discussed in sections B–1 through B–3 of this appendix. Note that if the credit union limits the maximum amount of shares which may be held by one member under <em>NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws,</em> Art. III, section 2, that this should be stated in item no. 7, transaction limitations. Item no. 9 reflects various terms provided in Art. III, sections 3–6 of the <em>NCUA Standard FCU Bylaws.</em> Item no. 10 reflects the par value amount of regular shares in a federal credit union, pursuant to section 117 of the FCU Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/117" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 117</a>. It also states the dividend period of the credit union, which is set by the board of directors. Item no. 11 addresses the requirements of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-740" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 740</a>. Non-federally insured credit unions (NICUs) would be expected to disclose information required by section 151 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1831t" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1831t</a>. By December 19, 1992, all NICUs were required to include conspicuously on all periodic statements of account, signature cards, passbooks, share certificates and other similar instruments of deposit and in all advertising a notice that the credit union is not federally insured. Additional disclosures will be required of NICUs by June 19, 1994. Item no. 12 is inserted to ensure that credit unions add other account terms and conditions not covered by the proposed regulation. These sorts of terms are contemplated by proposed <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.3#p-707.3(b)" class="cfr external">§ 707.3(b)</a>, requiring that the disclosures reflect the terms of the legal obligation between the member and the credit union. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but to give a general idea of other topics often covered in share account contracts. Item no. 12 is not expressly required by either TISA or part 707, but any of these terms that are disclosed must be accurate and not misleading. Also the Board strongly recommends that such terms are included in account opening disclosures to inform the membership and to clearly set forth the legal relationship between the members and their credit union.</p>

<p>This form is modeled on the share account disclosures in the <em>Accounting Manual for FCUs,</em> <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-5150.7" class="cfr external">§ 5150.7</a>. The disclosures are for a variable-rate, average daily balance method dividend calculation share draft account in an FCU with no minimum balance requirement. For purposes of this example, the account was opened on January 15, 1995. The Credit Union has monthly dividend periods. Other terms are self-explanatory. The dividend rate paid and annual percentage yield disclosures will reflect the prospective dividend rate for a given dividend period. The disclosures are very similar to the ones in section B–6 of appendix B, except for the rollback and par value disclosures, which have been removed from the final rule and appendices.</p>

<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Official status.</em>  This commentary is the means by which the staff of the Office of General Counsel of the National Credit Union Administration issues official staff interpretations of Part 707 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Good faith compliance with this commentary affords protection from liability under section 271(f) of the Truth in Savings Act (TISA), <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4311" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 4311</a>. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Section 707.1—Authority, Purpose, Coverage, and Effect on State Laws </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">(c) Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Foreign applicability.</em>  Part 707 applies to all credit unions that offer share and deposit accounts to residents (including resident aliens) of any state as defined in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-707.2#p-707.2(v)" class="cfr external">§ 707.2(v)</a> and that offer accounts insurable by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) whether or not such accounts are insured by the NCUSIF. Corporate credit unions designated as such by NCUA under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-704.2" class="cfr external">12 CFR 704.2</a> (definition of “corporate credit union”) are exempt from part 707. </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Persons who advertise accounts.</em>  Persons who advertise accounts are subject to the advertising rules. This includes agent and agented accounts, such as a member who subdivides interests in a jumbo term share certificate account for sale to other parties or among members who form a certificate account investment club. For example, if an agent places an advertisement that offers members an interest in an account at a credit union, the advertising rules apply to the advertisement, whether the account is held by the agent or directly by the member. </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Nonautomated credit unions.</em>  Nonautomated credit unions with an asset size of $2 million or less, after subtracting any nonmember deposits, are exempt from TISA and part 707. NCUA defines a “nonautomated credit union” as a credit union without sufficient data processing capability and capacity to establish, operate and maintain a share and loan software system to timely and accurately process all account transactions of all members. The nonautomated credit union exemption is available to all credit unions meeting the asset size and automation standards of this comment, including newly chartered credit unions. If any of the credit unions eligible for this exemption grow to have more than $2 million in assets as of December 31 of any year, the NCUA Board will require such credit unions to comply with TISA and part 707 on January 1 of one year after such credit union loses its exemption eligibility. Similarly, if a credit union becomes sufficiently automated to operate a complete share and loan system, such credit union will be entitled to the same compliance phase-in period. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">(d) Effect on State Laws </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Preemption of state laws/Inconsistent requirements.</em>  State law requirements that are inconsistent with the requirements of TISA and part 707 are preempted to the extent of the inconsistency. A state law is inconsistent if it requires a credit union to make disclosures or take actions that contradict the requirements of the federal law. A state law is also contradictory if it requires the use of the same term to represent a different amount or a different meaning than the federal law, requires the use of a term different from that required in the federal law to describe the same item, or permits a method of calculating dividends or interest on an account different from that required in the federal law. </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Preemption determinations.</em>  A credit union, state, or other interested party may request the Board to determine whether a state law requirement is inconsistent with the federal requirements. A request for a determination should be addressed to NCUA's Office of General Counsel, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314. Written preemption requests should cite (or include a copy of) the allegedly inconsistent state law, demonstrate the inconsistency with TISA and part 707 and the burden on credit unions, and formally request a preemption determination. The Office of General Counsel may provide other interested parties, particularly affected states, an informal opportunity to comment on any request for a preemption determination, unless it finds that such notice and opportunity for comment would be impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest. NCUA will publicize any preemption determinations using any means readily at its disposal. </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Effect of preemption determinations.</em>  After the Board, through its Office of General Counsel, determines that a state law is inconsistent, a credit union may not make disclosures using the inconsistent term or take actions relying on the inconsistent law. </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Reversal of determination.</em>  The Board reserves the right to reverse a determination for any reason bearing on the coverage or effect of state or federal law. </p>

For example, credit unions can use adjectives and trade names to describe accounts such as “Best Share Draft Account,” or “Ultra Money Market Share Account.” Synonyms for share, share draft, money market share, and term share accounts may be used to describe various types of credit union share and deposit accounts as long as the synonym is accurate and not misleading and, for account disclosures, is used in conjunction with the correct legal term. For example, the following synonyms may be used: </p>
<p class="indent-2" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(5.)(i.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">i<span class="paren">.</span></span> The term “checking account” may be used to describe share draft accounts. </p>

<p class="indent-2" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(5.)(iv.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">iv<span class="paren">.</span></span> The terms “share certificate,” “certificate account,” or “certificate” may be used to describe share certificates and other dividend-bearing term share accounts. </p>
<p class="indent-2" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-707(5.)(v.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">v<span class="paren">.</span></span> However, under no circumstances may a credit union describe a share account as a deposit account, or vice versa. For example, the term “certificate of deposit” or “CD” may not be used to describe share certificates and other dividend-bearing term share accounts. Similarly, the terms “time account” (used in Regulation DD, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1030.2#p-1030.2(u)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 1030.2(u)</a>) and “time deposit” (used in Federal Reserve Board's Regulation D, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-204.2#p-204.2(c)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 204.2(c)</a>) may not be used to describe term share accounts. </p>

The annual percentage yield shows the total amount of dividends for a 365 day period (or a 366 day period for a leap year) on an assumed principal amount based on the dividend rate and frequency of compounding as a percentage of the assumed principal (for accounts such as share or share draft accounts) or for the total amount of dividends over the term of the account for term share accounts.

Unlike the annual percentage yield, the annual percentage yield earned is affected by additions and withdrawals during the period.

The bonus rules are triggered, since members are eligible under the promotion to receive up to $28 during the year. However, the bonus rules are not triggered if an item valued at $7 is offered to members opening a share draft account during the month of January, even though in November the credit union introduces a new promotion that includes, for example, an offer to existing share draft accountholders for an item valued at $8 for maintaining an average balance of $5,000 for the month. </p>

Federal credit unions may only offer dividend-bearing and non-dividend-bearing share accounts. State-chartered credit unions may offer both share and deposit accounts if permitted by state law. State law, including without limitation regulations and official interpretations, will determine if returns earned in accounts in state-chartered credit unions are dividends. Dividends exclude the payment of a bonus or other consideration worth $10 or less given during a year, the waiver or reduction of a fee, the absorption of expenses, non-dividend membership benefits and extraordinary dividends.

Generally, dividends may be viewed as a portion of the available account and undivided earnings of the credit union which is set apart, after required transfer to reserves, by valid act of the board of directors, for distribution among the members. As a matter of legal procedure, members are usually not entitled to dividends until the following steps are completed: </p>

Generally, it is the declaration of the dividend itself which creates the dividend and the member has no right to receive a dividend until it is so declared. The decision of when to declare dividends lies within the official discretion of each credit union's board of directors and cannot be abrogated by contract. An agreement to pay dividends on a share account is generally interpreted not as an obligation to pay the stipulated dividends absolutely and unconditionally, but as an undertaking to pay them out of the earnings when sufficiently accumulated from which dividends in general are properly payable. Generally, “prospective rates” are rates set in good faith in advance of the close of a dividend period, that may be altered if sufficient funds are not available, or in the event of a superseding event, such as a strike, plant closure, significant fluctuation in market rates and/or a significant change in financial structure, natural disaster or emergency that alters the assumptions under which the “prospective rates” were made. It is the intent of TISA that all disclosure be accurate when made, and credit unions are urged to make every effort to ratify disclosed “prospective rates.” “Prospective rates” may also be referred to as “projected rates” or similar wording, but not as “estimated rates.” (See comment 3(b)–2, prohibiting use of estimates). </p>

This method is also known as the “hybrid” or “plateau” tiered-rate account. In Tiering Method B accounts, the credit union does not pay the applicable tiered dividends rate on the entire amount in the account, but only on the portion of the share account balance that falls within each specified tier.

Similarly, a credit union that calculates dividends on the average daily balance method must use the average daily balance method to determine if the minimum to earn dividends has been met. Credit unions may have a par value of a share that is different from the minimum balance requirement to earn dividends. (See commentary to § 707.4(b)(3)(i)). </p>

For example, if a credit union assesses a fee in January and refunds the fee in February, the credit union could disclose a year-to-date total reflecting the amount credited, but it should not affect the total disclosed for the February statement period, because the fee was not assessed in the February statement period. If a credit union assesses and then waives and credits a fee within the same cycle, the credit union may, at its option, reflect the adjustment in the total disclosed for fees imposed during the current statement period and for the total for the calendar year-to-date.

Regardless of the dividend calculation method, the balance used in the annual percentage yield earned formula is the average daily balance. The average daily balance calculation is the sum of the balances for each day in the period divided by the number of days in the period. The balance for each day is based on a point in time; i.e. beginning of day balance, end of day balance, closing of day balance, etc. Each day's balance, for dividend accrual and payment purposes, must be based on the same point in time and cannot be based on the day's low balance. </p>

For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends monthly, the balance may not be increased each day to reflect the effect of daily compounding. Assume a credit union will pay $13.70 in dividends on $100,000 for the first day, $6.85 in dividends on $50,013.70 for the second day, and $3.43 in dividends on $25,020.55 for the third day. The sum of each days balance is $175,000 (does not include accrued, but uncredited, dividends amounts $13.70, $6.85, and $3.43), thereby resulting in an average daily balance for the three days of $58,333.33. </p>

For example, if monthly statements are sent for an account that compounds dividends daily and credits dividends quarterly, the balance for the second monthly statement would include dividends that had accrued for the prior month. Assume a credit union will pay $411.78 in dividends on 30 days of $100,000, $427.28 in dividends on 31 days of $100,411.78, and $415.23 in dividends on 30 days of $100,839.06.

For example, if the dividends earned for a statement period is $20.074 and the credit union pays the member $20.07, the credit union must use $20.07 (not $20.074) to calculate the annual percentage yield earned. For accounts that pay dividends based on the daily balance method, compound and credit dividends or interest quarterly, and send monthly statements, the credit union may, but need not, round accrued dividends to two decimals for calculating the “projected” or “anticipated” annual percentage yield earned on the first two monthly statements issued during the quarter. However, on the quarterly statement the dividends earned figure must reflect the amount actually paid. </p>

This formula must be used for accounts that compound and credit dividends quarterly and that receive monthly statements, triggered by Regulation E, which comply with the provisions of § 707.6. </p>
