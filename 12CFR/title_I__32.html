<p class="hd2-paragraph">Section 1. Interrelation of General Limitation With Exception for Loans To Develop Domestic Residential Housing Units </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-32(1.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-32(1.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-32 1."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-32.3#p-32.3(d)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 32.3(d)(2)</a> exception for loans to one borrower to develop domestic residential housing units is characterized in the regulation as an “alternative” limit. This exceptional $30,000,000 or 30 percent limitation does not operate in addition to the 15 percent General Limitation or the 10 percent additional amount a savings association may loan to one borrower secured by readily marketable collateral, but serves as the uppermost limitation on a savings association's lending to any one person once a savings association employs this exception. </p>
<div class="example">
<h1>Example:</h1>
<p class="inline-paragraph">Savings Association A's lending limitation as calculated under the 15 percent General Limitation is $800, 000. If Savings Association A lends Y $800,000 for commercial purposes, Savings Association A cannot lend Y an additional $1,600,000, or 30 percent of capital and surplus, to develop residential housing units under the paragraph <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-32.3#p-32.3(d)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 32.3(d)(2)</a> exception. The <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-32.3#p-32.3(d)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 32.3(d)(2)</a> exception operates as the uppermost limitation on all lending to one borrower (for savings associations that may employ this exception) and includes any amounts loaned to the same borrower under the General Limitation. Savings Association A, therefore, may lend only an additional $800,000 to Y, provided <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-32.3#p-32.3(d)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 32.3(d)(2)</a> prerequisites have been met. The amount loaned under the authority of the General Limitation ($800,000), when added to the amount loaned under the exception ($800,000), yields a sum that does not exceed the 30 percent uppermost limitation ($1,600,000).</p>

(The latter is $800,000 because in no event may the total lending to Y exceed 30 percent of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus). If Savings Association A did not lend Y the remaining $100,000 permissible under the General Limitation, its permissible loans to develop domestic residential housing units under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-32.3#p-32.3(d)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 32.3(d)(2)</a> would be $900,000 instead of $800,000 (the total loans to Y would still equal $1,600,000). </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph">Section 2. Interrelationship Between the General Limitation and the 150 Percent Aggregate Limit on Loans to All Borrowers To Develop Domestic Residential Housing Units </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Numerous questions have been received regarding the allocation of loans between the different lending limit “baskets,” <em>i.e.,</em> the 15 percent General Limitation basket and the 30 percent Residential Development basket. In general, the inquiries concern the manner in which a savings association may “move” a loan from the General Limitation basket to the Residential Development basket. The following example is intended to provide guidance: </p>
<div class="example">
<h1>Example:</h1>
<p class="inline-paragraph">Savings Association A's General Limitation under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-32.3#p-32.3(a)" class="cfr external">§ 32.3(a)</a> is $15 million. In January, Savings Association A makes a $10 million loan to Borrower to develop domestic residential housing units. At the time the loan was made, Savings Association A had not received approval under an order issued by the appropriate Federal banking agency to avail itself of the residential development exception to lending limits. Therefore, the $10 million loan is made under Savings Association A's General Limitation.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">2. In June, Savings Association A receives authorization to lend under the Residential Development exception. In July, Savings Association A lends $3 million to Borrower to develop domestic residential housing units. In August, Borrower seeks an additional $12 million commercial loan from Savings Association A. Savings Association A cannot make the loan to Borrower, however, because it already has an outstanding $10 million loan to Borrower that counts against Savings Association A's General Limitation of $15 million. Thus, Savings Association A may lend only up to an additional $5 million to Borrower under the General Limitation. </p>

The full $13 million residential development loan counts toward Savings Association A's aggregate 150 percent limitation. </p>
