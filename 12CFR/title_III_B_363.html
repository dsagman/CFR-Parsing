<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-363" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-363">Introduction </p>
<p>Congress added section 36, “Early Identification of Needed Improvements in Financial Management” (section 36), to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) in 1991. </p>
<p>The FDIC Board of Directors adopted <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-363" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 363</a> of its rules and regulations (the Rule) to implement those provisions of section 36 that require rulemaking. The FDIC also approved these “Guidelines and Interpretations” (the Guidelines) and directed that they be published with the Rule to facilitate a better understanding of, and full compliance with, the provisions of section 36. </p>
<p>Although not contained in the Rule itself, some of the guidance offered restates or refers to statutory requirements of section 36 and is therefore mandatory. If that is the case, the statutory provision is cited. </p>
<p>Furthermore, upon adopting the Rule, the FDIC reiterated its belief that every insured depository institution, regardless of its size or charter, should have an annual audit of its financial statements performed by an independent public accountant, and should establish an audit committee comprised entirely of outside directors. </p>
<p>The following Guidelines reflect the views of the FDIC concerning the interpretation of section 36. The Guidelines are intended to assist insured depository institutions (institutions), their boards of directors, and their advisors, including their independent public accountants and legal counsel, and to clarify section 36 and the Rule. It is recognized that reliance on the Guidelines may result in compliance with section 36 and the Rule which may vary from institution to institution. Terms which are not explained in the Guidelines have the meanings given them in the Rule, the FDI Act, or professional accounting and auditing literature. </p>

Notwithstanding management's exclusion of the acquired business's internal control from its assessment, management should disclose any material change to the institution's internal control over financial reporting due to the acquisition of this business. Also, management may not omit the assessment of the acquired business's internal control from more than one annual part 363 assessment report on internal control over financial reporting.

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In the United States, <em>Internal Control—Integrated Framework,</em> including its addendum on safeguarding assets, which was published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and is known as the COSO report, provides a suitable and recognized framework for purposes of management's assessment. Other suitable frameworks have been published in other countries or may be developed in the future. Such other suitable frameworks may be used by management and the institution's independent public accountant in assessments, attestations, and audits of internal control over financial reporting. </p>

However, use of the illustrative management reports and cover letter is not required. The managements of insured depository institutions are encouraged to tailor the wording of their management reports and cover letters to fit their particular circumstances, especially when reporting on material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting or noncompliance with designated laws and regulations. Terms that are not explained in Appendix B have the meanings given them in part 363, the FDI Act, or professional accounting and auditing literature. Instructions to the preparer of the management reports are shown in brackets within the illustrative reports. </p>

Guideline 4A in Appendix A to part 363 identifies the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements in the Call Report and TFR. When internal control assessments and attestations are performed at the holding company level, the FDIC believes that holding companies have flexibility in interpreting “financial reporting” as it relates to “regulatory reporting” and has not objected to several reporting approaches employed by holding companies to cover “regulatory reporting.” Certain holding companies have had management's assessment and the accountant's attestation cover the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements that are included in the appropriate regulatory report, <em>e.g.,</em> Call Report and the TFR, of each subsidiary institution subject to part 363. Other holding companies have had management's assessment and the accountant's attestation cover the schedules equivalent to the basic financial statements that are included in the holding company's year-end regulatory report (FR Y–9C report) to the Federal Reserve Board. </p>
