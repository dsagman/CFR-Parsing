This section also establishes the rules and requirements regarding the submission and content of a resolution plan as well as procedures for review by the FDIC of a resolution plan. This section requires a covered insured depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (“FDI Act”), <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1821" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1821</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1823" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1823</a>, in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution. This rule is intended to ensure that the FDIC has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve efficiently a covered insured depository institution in the event of its failure. </p>

</h4>
<p>This is the structure for the data file to provide deposit data to the FDIC. If data or information are not maintained or do not apply, a null value in the appropriate field should be indicated. The file will be in a tab-or pipe-delimited ASCII format. Each file name will contain the institution's FDIC Certificate Number, an indication that it is a deposit file type and the date of the extract. The files will be encrypted using an FDIC-supplied algorithm. The FDIC will transmit to the covered institution the encryption algorithm over FDIC<em>connect.</em> </p>
<p>The total deposit balances and the number of deposit accounts in each deposit file must be reconciled to the subsidiary system control totals. </p>
<p>The FDIC intends to fully utilize a covered institution's understanding of its customers and the data maintained around deposit accounts. Should additional information be available to the covered institution to help the FDIC more quickly complete its insurance determination process, it may add this information to the end of this data file. Should additional data elements be provided, a complete data dictionary for these elements must be supplied along with a description of how this information could be best used to establish account ownership or insurance category. </p>
<p>The deposit data elements provide information specific to deposit account balances and account data. The sequencing of these elements, their physical data structures and the field data format and field length must be provided to the FDIC along with the data structures identified below. </p>
<p>A header record will also be required at the beginning of this file. This record will contain the number of accounts to be included in this file, the maximum number of characters contained in largest account title field maintained within the deposit file and the maximum number of characters contained in largest address field maintained within the deposit file. </p>
<div class="note">
<div class="header">Note:</div>
<p>Each record must contain the account title/name and current account statement mailing address. Fields 17–33 relate to the account name and address information. Some systems provide for separate fields for account title/name, street address, city, state, ZIP, and country, all of which are parsed out. Others systems may simply provide multiple lines for name, street address, city, state, ZIP, with no distinction. Populate fields that best fit the system's data, either fields 17–27 or fields 28–33.</p>

<p>This is the structure of the data file to provide information to the FDIC on funds residing in investment vehicles linked to each non-closed deposit account or sub-account: (1) Involved in sweep activity where the sweep investment vehicle is not a deposit and is reflected on the books and records of the covered institution or (2) which accepts automated credits. A single record should be used for each instance where funds affiliated with the deposit account are held in an alternative investment vehicle. For any alternative investment vehicle, a separate account may or may not exist. If an account exists for the investment vehicle, it should be noted in the record. If no account exists, then a null value for the Sweep/Automated Credit Account Identifiers should be provided, but the remainder of the data fields defined below should be populated. </p>
<p>For data provided in the Sweep/Automated Credit Account File, the total account balances and the number of accounts must be reconciled to subsidiary system control totals. The file will be in a tab- or pipe-delimited ASCII format. The files will be encrypted using an FDIC-supplied algorithm.

</h4>
<p>This is the structure of the data file to provide to the FDIC information necessary to link the records in the deposit and customer files. If data or information are not maintained or do not apply, a null value in the appropriate field should be indicated. The file will be in a tab- or pipe-delimited ASCII format. Each file name will contain the institution's FDIC Certificate Number, an indication that it is a join file type and the date of the extract. The files will be encrypted using an FDIC-supplied algorithm. The FDIC will transmit the encryption algorithm over FDIC<em>connect.</em> </p>
<p>The deposit-customer join file will have one or more records for each deposit account, depending on the number of relationships to each account. A simple individual account, for example, will be associated with only one record in the deposit-customer join file indicating the owner of the account. A joint account with two owners will be associated with two records in the deposit-customer join file, one for each owner. The deposit-customer join file will contain other records associated with a deposit account to designate, among other things, beneficiaries, custodians, trustees and agents. This methodology allows the FDIC to know all of the possible relationships for an individual account and also whether a single customer is involved in many accounts. </p>

</h4>
<p>A covered institution must provide deposit data using separate deposit, sweep/automated credit, hold, customer, and deposit-customer join files. The simplest file structure involves providing one of each file. This basic file format is shown in Figure 1. </p>
<a href="https://img.federalregister.gov/ER17JY08.000/ER17JY08.000_original_size.png"><img src="https://img.federalregister.gov/ER17JY08.000/ER17JY08.000_large.png" loading="lazy" style="height: 523px; width: 823px;"></a>
<p>Multiple combinations of deposit, sweep/automated credit, hold, customer, and deposit-customer join files are permissible, but only in the following circumstances: </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-H-to-Part-360(1.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-H-to-Part-360(1.)" data-title="Appendix-H-to-Part-360 1."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Each separate deposit file must have companion sweep/automated credit and hold files covering the same deposit accounts. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-H-to-Part-360(2.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-H-to-Part-360(2.)" data-title="Appendix-H-to-Part-360 2."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> A single customer file may be submitted covering customers affiliated with deposit accounts in one or more deposit files as long as the customer file contains information on all of the customers affiliated with the deposit files. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-H-to-Part-360(3.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-H-to-Part-360(3.)" data-title="Appendix-H-to-Part-360 3."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> Several customer files may be submitted as long as each separate customer file contains information on all of the customers affiliated with the associated deposit files. </p>
</div>
<p>Figure 2 shows a permissible file configuration using a single Customer File affiliated with Deposit File A and Deposit File B. As required, Deposit File A has a companion Sweep/Automated Credit File A and Hold File A. The same is true for Deposit File B. </p>
<p>Another permissible combination of files is shown in Figure 3, which is a variation of the basic data file structure shown in Figure 1. </p>
