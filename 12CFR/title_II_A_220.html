</div>
<div id="p-220.103(b)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.103(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.6#p-220.6(h)" class="cfr external">Section 220.6(h)</a> does not require that the lender of the securities in such a case be a member of a national securities exchange or a broker or dealer. Therefore, a borrowing of securities may be able to qualify under the provision even though the lender is a private individual, and this is true whether the security is registered on a national securities exchange or is unregistered. In borrowing securities from a private individual under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.6#p-220.6(h)" class="cfr external">§ 220.6(h)</a>, however, it becomes especially important to bear in mind two limitations that are contained in the section. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-220.103(c)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.103(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> The first limitation is that the section applies only if the broker borrows the securities for the purpose specified in the provision, that is, “for the purpose of making delivery of such securities in the case of short sales, failure to receive securities he is required to deliver, or other similar cases”. The present language of the provision does not require that the delivery for which the securities are borrowed must be on a transaction which the borrower has himself made, either as agent or as principal; he may borrow under the provision in order to relend to someone else for the latter person to make such a delivery. However, the borrowing must be related to an actual delivery of the type specified—a delivery in connection with a specific transaction that has already occurred or is in immediate prospect. The provision does not authorize a broker to borrow securities (or make the related deposit) merely in order that he or some other broker may have the securities “on hand” or may anticipate some need that may or may not arise in the future. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-220.103(d)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.103(d)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>d<span class="paren">)</span></span> The ruling in the 1940 Federal Reserve Bulletin, at page 647, is an example of a borrowing which, on the facts as given, did not meet the requirement. There, the broker wished to borrow stocks with the understanding that he “would offer to lend this stock in the ‘loan crowd’ on a national securities exchange.” There was no assurance that the stocks would be used for the purpose specified in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.6#p-220.6(h)" class="cfr external">§ 220.6(h)</a>; they might be, or they might merely be held idle while the person lending the stocks had the use of the funds deposited against them. The ruling held in effect that since the borrowing could not qualify under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.6#p-220.6(h)" class="cfr external">§ 220.6(h)</a> it must comply with other applicable provisions of the regulation. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-220.103(e)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.103(e)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>e<span class="paren">)</span></span> The second requirement is that the deposit of cash against the borrowed securities must be “bona fide.” This requirement naturally cannot be spelled out in detail, but it requires at least that the purpose of the broker in making the deposit should be to obtain the securities for the specified purpose, and that he should not use the arrangement as a means of accommodating a customer who is seeking to obtain more funds than he could get in a general account. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-220.103(f)"><p class="indent-1" data-title="220.103(f)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>f<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Board recognizes that even with these requirements there is still some possibility that the provision may be misapplied. The Board is reluctant to impose additional burdens on legitimate transactions by tightening the provision. If there should be evidence of abuses developing under the provision, however, it would become necessary to consider making it more restricted. </p></div>

In other words, the privilege of delayed payment in such an account is withdrawn during the 90-day period. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.105(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Board recently considered a question as to whether the following situation makes an account subject to the 90-day disqualification: A customer purchases registered security ABC in a special cash account. The broker executes the order in good faith as a bona fide cash transaction, expecting to obtain full cash payment promptly. The next day, the customer sells registered security XYZ in the account, promising to deposit it promptly in the account. The proceeds of the sale are equal to or greater than the cost of security ABC. After both sale and purchase have been made, the customer requests the broker to deliver security ABC to a different broker, to receive security XYZ from that broker at about the same time, and to settle with the other broker—such settlement to be made either by paying the cost of security XYZ to the other broker and receiving from him the cost of security ABC, or by merely settling any difference between these amounts. </p>
</div>

In the instant case, unlike that described at 1940 Federal Reserve Bulletin 772, the security sold is not held in the account and is not to be deposited in it unconditionally. It is to be obtained only against the delivery to the other broker of the security which had been purchased. Hence payment can not be said to have been made prior to such delivery; the purchased security has been delivered out to a broker without previously having been paid for in full, and the account becomes subject to the 90-day disqualification. </p></div>

The Board stated that the part rather clearly would not apply if there appeared to be nothing other than loans by the credit union to its members to finance purchases made directly by them of stock of the parent corporation of the employer of the member-borrowers. The additional fact that the credit union, as agent, would purchase such stock for its members (even though all such purchases might not be financed by credit union loans) was not viewed by the Board as sufficient to make the regulation applicable where, as from the facts presented, it did not appear that the credit union in any case was to make any charge or receive any compensation for assisting in such purchases or that the credit union otherwise was engaged in securities activities. However, the Board stated that matters of this kind must be examined closely for any variations that might suggest the inapplicability of the foregoing. </p></div>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.111(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> The matter is treated generally in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.7#p-220.7(a)" class="cfr external">§ 220.7(a)</a> and is also subject to the general rule of law that any person who aids or abets a violation of law by another is himself guilty of a violation. It may be stated as a general principle that any person who arranges for credit to be extended by someone else has a responsibility so to conduct his activities as not to be a participant in a violation of this part, which applies to brokers, or <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-221" class="cfr external">part 221 of this subchapter</a>, which applies to banks. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.111(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> More specifically, in arranging an extension of credit that may be subject to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-221" class="cfr external">part 221 of this subchapter</a>, a broker must act in good faith and, therefore, must question the accuracy of any non-purpose statement (i.e., a statement that the loan is not for the purpose of purchasing or carrying registered stocks) given in connection with the loan where the circumstances are such that the broker from any source knows or has reason to know that the statement is incomplete or otherwise inaccurate as to the true purpose of the credit. The requirement of “good faith” is of vital importance. While the application of the requirement will necessarily vary with the facts of the particular case, the broker, like the bank for whom the loan is arranged to be made, must be alert to the circumstances surrounding the loan. Thus, for example, if a broker or dealer is to deliver registered stocks to secure the loan or is to receive the proceeds of the loan, the broker arranging the loan and the bank making it would be put on notice that the loan would probably be subject to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-221" class="cfr external">part 221 of this subchapter</a>. In any such circumstances they could not in good faith accept or rely upon a statement to the contrary without obtaining a reliable and satisfactory explanation of the situation. The foregoing, of course, applies the principles contained in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-221.101" class="cfr external">§ 221.101 of this subchapter</a>. </p>

Accordingly, in such cases the statutes and regulations forbid the approached broker to arrange extensions of credit on unregistered securities for the purpose of purchasing or carrying either registered or unregistered securities. The approaching broker would also be violating the applicable requirements if he initiated or otherwise participated in any such forbidden transactions. </p>

Although the securities are available for prompt delivery by the broker-dealer firm selected to effect the system's purchase, it is arranged in advance with the firm that the system will not accept delivery and pay for the securities before some date more than seven business days after the date on which the securities are purchased. Apparently, such an arrangement is occasioned by the monthly or semimonthly meetings of the system's supervisors. It was indicated that a retirement system of this kind may be supervised by officials who administer it as an incidental part of their regular duties, and that meetings requiring joint action by two or more supervisors may be necessary under the system's rules and procedures to authorize issuance of checks in payment for the securities purchased. It was indicated also that the purchases do not involve exempted securities, securities of the kind covered by <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.4#p-220.4(c)(3)" class="cfr external">§ 220.4(c)(3)</a>, or any shipment of securities as described in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.4#p-220.4(c)" class="cfr external">§ 220.4(c)</a>. </p>

In instances of this kind, institutional investors (e.g., insurance companies or pension funds) whose cash flow is such that they expect to have funds available some months in the future, have been willing to subscribe to a portion, to be issued to them at a future date. The issuer has been willing to agree to issue the securities in two or more stages because it did not immediately need the proceeds to be realized from the deferred portion, because it could not raise funds on better terms, or because it preferred to have a certain portion of the issue taken down by an investor of this type. </p>

For the purposes of this interpretation, the term “tax-shelter program” means a program which is required to be registered pursuant to section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. section 77e), in which tax benefits, such as the ability to deduct substantial amounts of depreciation or oil exploration expenses, are made available to a person investing in the program.

The balance of the purchase price after the downpayment usually is payable in installments which range from 1 to 10 years depending on the program.

Thus, where the appropriate position is held in an account, that position may serve as the margin required by <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.3#p-220.3(d)(5)" class="cfr external">§ 220.3(d)(5)</a>. </p>

He may have established either position, properly margined, prior to taking the other, or he may have deposited fully paid securities in his margin account on the same day he makes a short sale of such securities. In either case, he will have directed his broker to borrow securities elsewhere in order to make delivery on the short sale rather than using his long position for this purpose (see also <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-17/section-240.3b-3" class="cfr external">17 CFR 240.3b–3</a>). </p>

That section provides, in essence, that the margin otherwise required in connection with a short sale need not be included in the account if the customer has in the account a long position in the same security.

In this situation, no change in the beneficial ownership of stock has taken place. Since there is no actual “<em>contra</em>” party to either transaction, and no stock has been borrowed or delivered to accomplish the short sale, such fictitious positions would have no value for purposes of the Board's margin regulations. Indeed, the adoption of such a scheme in connection with an overall strategy involving the issuance, endorsement, or guarantee of put or call options or combinations thereof appears to be manipulative and may have been employed for the purpose of circumventing the requirements of the regulations. </p></div>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.131(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> SEC Rule 144A provides a safe harbor exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 for resales of restricted securities to <em>qualified institutional buyers,</em> as defined in the rule. In general, a <em>qualified institutional buyer</em> is an institutional investor that in the aggregate owns and invests on a discretionary basis at least $100 million in securities of issuers that are not affiliated with the buyer. Registered broker-dealers need only own and invest on a discretionary basis at least $10 million of securities in order to purchase as principal under the rule. Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 provides an exemption from the registration requirements for “transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering.” Securities acquired in a transaction under section 4(2) cannot be resold without registration under the Act or an exemption therefrom. Rule 144A provides a safe harbor exemption for resales of such securities. Accordingly, broker-dealers that previously acted only as agents in intermediating between issuers and purchasers of privately-placed securities, due to the lack of such a safe harbor, now may purchase privately-placed securities from issuers as principal and resell such securities to “qualified institutional buyers” under Rule 144A. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="220.131(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Board has consistently treated the purchase of a privately-placed debt security as an extension of credit subject to the margin regulations. If the issuer uses the proceeds to buy securities, the purchase of the privately-placed debt security by a creditor represents an extension of “purpose credit” to the issuer. Section 7(c) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits the extension of purpose credit by a creditor if the credit is unsecured, secured by collateral other than securities, or secured by any security (other than an exempted security) in contravention of Federal Reserve regulations. If a debt security sold pursuant to Rule 144A represents purpose credit and is not properly collateralized by securities, the statute and Regulation T can be viewed as preventing the broker-dealer from taking the security into inventory in spite of the fact that the broker-dealer intends to immediately resell the debt security. </p>

Investment banking services are defined to include, but not be limited to, “underwritings, private placements, and advice and other services in connection with exchange offers, mergers, or acquisitions, except for underwritings that involve the public distribution of an equity security with installment or other deferred-payment provisions.” To comply with Regulations G and U where the proceeds of debt securities sold under Rule 144A may be used to purchase or carry margin stock and the debt securities are secured in whole or in part, directly or indirectly by margin stock (see <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-207.2#p-207.2(f)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 207.2(f)</a>, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-207.112" class="cfr external">207.112</a>, and <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-221.2#p-221.2(g)" class="cfr external">221.2(g)</a>), the margin requirements of the regulations must be met. </p>

The market-making activities of broker-dealers who hold themselves out to other institutions as willing to buy and sell Rule 144A securities on a regular and continuous basis may also be considered an arranging of credit permissible under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-220.13#p-220.13(a)" class="cfr external">§ 220.13(a)</a> of Regulation T. </p></div>
