<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(I.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 I.">I. Introduction </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”)<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-1" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  authorizes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “Council”) to determine that a nonbank financial company will be supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”) and be subject to prudential standards in accordance with Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act if either of two standards is met. Under the first standard, the Council may subject a nonbank financial company to supervision by the Federal Reserve and prudential standards if the Council determines that material financial distress at the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. Under the second standard, the Council may determine that a nonbank financial company will be supervised by the Federal Reserve and subject to prudential standards if the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. Section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act also lists considerations that the Council must take into account in making a determination. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section II of this document describes the approach the Council intends to take in prioritizing its work to identify and address potential risks to U.S. financial stability using an activities-based approach. This approach reflects the Council's priorities of identifying potential risks on a system-wide basis, reducing the potential for competitive distortions that could arise from entity-specific determinations, and allowing relevant financial regulatory agencies<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-2" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  to address identified potential risks. First, the Council will monitor markets to identify potential risks to U.S. financial stability and to assess those risks on a system-wide basis. Second, the Council will then work with relevant financial regulatory agencies to seek the implementation of actions intended to address identified potential risks to financial stability. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section III of this appendix describes the manner in which the Council intends to apply the statutory standards and considerations in making determinations under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, if the Council determines that potential risks to U.S. financial stability are not adequately addressed through the activities-based approach. Section III defines key terms used in the statute, including “threat to the financial stability of the United States.” Section III also includes a detailed description of the analysis that the Council intends to conduct during its reviews, including a discussion of channels through which risks from a company may be transmitted to other companies or markets, and the Council's assessment of the likelihood of the company's material financial distress and the benefits and costs of a determination. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section IV of this appendix outlines a two-stage process that the Council will follow in non-emergency situations when determining whether to subject a nonbank financial company to Federal Reserve supervision and prudential standards. In the first stage of the process, the Council will notify the company and its primary financial regulatory agency and conduct a preliminary analysis to determine whether the company should be subject to further evaluation by the Council. During the second stage of the evaluation process, the Council will conduct an in-depth evaluation if it determines in the first stage that the nonbank financial company merits additional review. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Council's practices set forth in this guidance to address potential risks to U.S. financial stability are intended to comply with its statutory purposes: (1) To identify risks to U.S. financial stability that could arise from the material financial distress or failure, or ongoing activities, of large, interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies, or that could arise outside the financial services marketplace; (2) to promote market discipline, by eliminating expectations on the part of shareholders, creditors, and counterparties of such companies that the government will shield them from losses in the event of failure; and (3) to respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-3" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>  Council actions seek to foster transparency and to avoid competitive distortions in markets for financial services and products. Further, nonbank financial companies should not benefit from an implicit federal financial safety net. Therefore, the Council emphasizes the importance of market discipline as a mechanism for addressing potential risks to U.S. financial stability posed by financial companies. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">This interpretive guidance is not a binding rule, except to the extent that it sets forth rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. This guidance is intended to assist financial companies and other market participants in understanding how the Council expects to exercise certain of its authorities under Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Council retains discretion, subject to applicable statutory requirements, to consider factors relevant to the assessment of a potential risk or threat to U.S. financial stability on a case-by-case basis. If the Council were to depart from the interpretative guidance, it would need to provide a reasoned explanation for its action, which would ordinarily require acknowledging the change in position.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-4" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-4">4</a>] </sup>  </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 II.">II. Activities-Based Approach </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Dodd-Frank Act gives the Council broad discretion in determining how to respond to potential threats to U.S. financial stability. A determination to subject a nonbank financial company to Federal Reserve supervision and prudential standards under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act is only one of several Council authorities for responding to potential risks to U.S. financial stability.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-5" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-5">5</a>] </sup>  The Council will prioritize its efforts to identify, assess, and address potential risks and threats to U.S. financial stability through a process that begins with an activities-based approach, and will pursue entity-specific determinations under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act only if a potential risk or threat cannot be adequately addressed through an activities-based approach. The Council anticipates it would consider a nonbank financial company for a potential determination under section 113 only in rare instances, such as if the products, activities, or practices of a company that pose a potential threat to U.S. financial stability are outside the jurisdiction or authority of financial regulatory agencies. This approach reflects two priorities: (1) Identifying and addressing, in consultation with relevant financial regulatory agencies, potential risks and emerging threats on a system-wide basis and to reduce the potential for competitive distortions among financial companies and in markets that could arise from entity-specific determinations, and (2) allowing relevant financial regulatory agencies, which generally possess greater information and expertise with respect to company, product, and market risks, to address potential risks, rather than subjecting the companies to new regulatory authorities. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">As part of its activities-based approach, the Council will examine a range of financial products, activities, or practices that could pose risks to U.S. financial stability. These types of activities are often identified in the Council's annual reports, such as activities related to (1) the extension of credit, (2) the use of leverage or short-term funding, (3) the provision of guarantees of financial performance, and (4) other key functions critical to support the functioning of financial markets. The Council considers a risk to financial stability to mean a risk of an event or development that could impair financial intermediation or financial market functioning to a degree that would be sufficient to inflict significant damage on the broader economy. The Council's activities-based approach is intended to identify and address risks to financial stability using a two-step approach, described below. </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 II.a.">a. Step One of Activities-Based Approach: Identifying Potential Risks From Products, Activities, or Practices </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Monitoring Markets </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council has a statutory duty to monitor the financial services marketplace in order to identify potential threats to U.S. financial stability.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-6" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-6">6</a>] </sup>  In the first step of the activities-based approach, to enable the Council to identify potential risks to U.S. financial stability, the Council, in consultation with relevant financial regulatory agencies, intends to monitor diverse financial markets and market developments to identify products, activities, or practices that could pose risks to U.S. financial stability. When monitoring potential risks to financial stability, the Council intends to consider the linkages across products, activities, and practices, and their interconnectedness across firms and markets. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">For example, the Council's monitoring may include: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Corporate and sovereign debt and loan markets; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• equity markets; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• markets for other financial products, including structured products and derivatives; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• short-term funding markets; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• payment, clearing, and settlement functions; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• new or evolving financial products, activities, and practices; and </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• developments affecting the resiliency of financial market participants. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">To monitor markets and market developments, the Council will review information such as historical data, research regarding the behavior of financial market participants, and new developments that arise in evolving marketplaces. The Council will regularly rely on data, research, and analysis from Council member agencies, the Office of Financial Research, industry participants, and other public sources. Consistent with its statutory obligations, the Council will, whenever possible, rely on information available from primary financial regulatory agencies.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-7" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-7">7</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Evaluating Potential Risks </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">If the Council's monitoring of markets and market developments identifies a product, activity, or practice that could pose a potential risk to U.S. financial stability, the Council, in consultation with relevant financial regulatory agencies, will evaluate the potential risk to determine whether it merits further review or action. The Council's work in this step may include efforts such as sharing data, research, and analysis among Council members and member agencies and their staffs; consultations with regulators and other experts regarding the scope of potential risks and factors that may mitigate those risks; and the collaborative development of analyses for consideration by the Council. As part of this work, the Council may also engage with industry participants and other members of the public as it assesses potential risks. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council will assess the extent to which characteristics such as the following could amplify potential risks to U.S. financial stability arising from products, activities, or practices: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Asset valuation risk or credit risk; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• leverage, including leverage arising from debt, derivatives, off-balance sheet obligations, and other arrangements; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• liquidity risk or maturity mismatch, such as reliance on funding sources that could be susceptible to dislocations; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• counterparty risk and interconnectedness among financial market participants; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the transparency of financial markets, such as growth in financial transactions occurring outside of regulated sectors; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• operational risks, such as cybersecurity and operational resilience; or </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the risk of destabilizing markets for particular types of financial instruments, such as trading practices that substantially increase volatility in key markets. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Various factors may exacerbate or mitigate each of these types of risks. For example, activities may pose greater risks if they are complex or opaque, are conducted without effective risk-management practices, are significantly correlated with other financial products, and are either highly concentrated or significant and widespread. In contrast, regulatory requirements or market practices may mitigate risks by, for example, limiting exposures or leverage, enhancing risk-management practices, or restricting excessive risk-taking. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">While the contours of the Council's initial evaluation of any potential risk will depend on the type and scope of analysis relevant to the particular risk, the Council's analyses will generally focus on four framing questions: </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(1.)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(1.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 II.a.1."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> How could the potential risk be triggered? For example, could it be triggered by sharp reductions in the valuation of particular classes of financial assets? </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(2.)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(2.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 II.a.2."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> How could the adverse effects of the potential risk be transmitted to financial markets or market participants? For example, what are the direct or indirect exposures in financial markets to the potential risk? </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(3.)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(3.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 II.a.3."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> What impact could the potential risk have on the financial system? For example, what could be the scale of its adverse effects on other companies and markets, and would its effects be concentrated or distributed broadly among market participants? This analysis should take into account factors such as existing regulatory requirements or market practices that mitigate potential risks. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(4.)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(a.)(4.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 II.a.4."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> Could the adverse effects of the potential risk impair the financial system in a manner that could harm the non-financial sector of the U.S. economy? </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">In this evaluation, the Council will consult with relevant financial regulatory agencies and will take into account existing laws and regulations that may mitigate a potential risk to U.S. financial stability. The Council will also take into account the risk profiles and business models of market participants engaging in the products, activities, or practices under evaluation, and consider available evidence regarding the potential risk. Empirical data may not be available regarding all potential risks, and the type and scope of the Council's analysis will be tailored to the potential risk under consideration. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">If a product, activity, or practice creating a potential risk to financial stability is identified, the Council will work with relevant financial regulatory agencies to address the identified risk, as described in section II.b of this appendix. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(b.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(II.)(b.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 II.b.">b. Step Two of Activities-Based Approach: Working With Regulators To Address Identified Risks </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">If the Council identifies a potential risk to U.S. financial stability in step one of the activities-based approach, the Council will work with the relevant financial regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels to seek the implementation of appropriate actions to address the identified potential risk. The Council will coordinate among its members and member agencies and will follow up on supervisory or regulatory actions to ensure the potential risk is adequately addressed. The goal of this step would be for existing regulators to take appropriate action, such as modifying their regulation or supervision of companies or markets under their jurisdiction in order to mitigate potential risks to U.S. financial stability identified by the Council.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-8" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-8">8</a>] </sup>  If a potential risk identified by the Council relates to a product, activity, or practice arising at a limited number of individual financial companies, the Council nonetheless will prioritize a remedy that addresses the underlying risk across all companies that engage in the relevant activity. If the Council finds that a particular type of financial product could present risks to U.S. financial stability, there may be different approaches existing regulators could take, based on their authorities and the urgency of the risk, such as restricting or prohibiting the offering of that product, or requiring market participants to take additional risk-management steps that address the risks. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">If, after engaging with relevant financial regulatory agencies, the Council believes those regulators' actions are inadequate to address the identified potential risk to U.S. financial stability, the Council has authority to make formal public recommendations to primary financial regulatory agencies under section 120 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Under section 120, the Council may provide for more stringent regulation of a financial activity by issuing nonbinding recommendations, following consultation with the primary financial regulatory agency and public notice inviting comments on proposed recommendations, to the primary financial regulatory agency to apply new or heightened standards or safeguards for a financial activity or practice conducted by bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies under their jurisdiction.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-9" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-9">9</a>] </sup>  In addition, in any case in which no primary financial regulatory agency exists for the markets or companies conducting financial activities or practices identified by the Council as posing risks, the Council can consider reporting to Congress on recommendations for legislation that would prevent such activities or practices from threatening U.S. financial stability. The Council intends to make recommendations under section 120 only to the extent that its recommendations are consistent with the statutory mandate of the primary financial regulatory agency to which the Council is making the recommendation. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The authority to issue recommendations to primary financial regulatory agencies under section 120 is one of the Council's most formal tools for responding to potential risks to U.S. financial stability. The Council will make these recommendations only if it determines that the conduct, scope, nature, size, scale, concentration, or interconnectedness of the activity or practice could create or increase the risk of significant liquidity, credit, or other problems spreading among bank holding companies and nonbank financial companies, U.S. financial markets, or low-income, minority, or underserved communities. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">In its recommendations under section 120, the Council may suggest broad approaches to address the risks it has identified. When appropriate, the Council may make a more specific recommendation. To promote analytical rigor and avoid duplication, before making any recommendation under section 120, the Council will ascertain whether the relevant primary financial regulatory agency would be expected to perform a cost-benefit analysis of the actions it would take in response to the Council's contemplated recommendation. In cases where the primary financial regulatory agency would not be expected to conduct such an analysis, the Council itself will—prior to making a final recommendation—conduct an analysis, using empirical data, to the extent available, of the benefits and costs of the actions that the primary financial regulatory agency would be expected to take in response to the contemplated recommendation. Where the Council conducts its own such analysis, the specificity of its assessment of benefits and costs would be commensurate with the specificity of the contemplated recommendation. Furthermore, where the Council conducts its own analysis, the Council will make a recommendation under section 120 only if it believes that the results of its assessment of benefits and costs support the recommendation. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Primary financial regulatory agencies have significant experience, knowledge, and expertise that can be useful in determining the most efficient way to address a particular risk within their regulatory jurisdiction. In every case, prior to issuing a recommendation under section 120, the Council will consult with the relevant primary financial regulatory agency and provide notice to the public and opportunity for comment as required by section 120. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(a.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 III.a.">a. Statutory Standards and Considerations </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council may determine, by a vote of not fewer than two-thirds of the voting members of the Council then serving, including an affirmative vote by the Chairperson of the Council, that a nonbank financial company will be supervised by the Federal Reserve and be subject to prudential standards if the Council determines that (1) material financial distress at the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States (the “First Determination Standard”) or (2) the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States (the “Second Determination Standard,” and, together with the First Determination Standard, the “Determination Standards”).<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-10" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-10">10</a>] </sup>  The analytic framework described below focuses primarily on the First Determination Standard because threats to financial stability (such as asset fire sales or financial market disruptions) are most commonly propagated through a nonbank financial company when it is in distress. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Several relevant terms used in the Dodd-Frank Act are not defined in the statute. The Council intends to interpret the term “company” to include any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, business trust, association, or similar organization.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-11" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-11">11</a>] </sup>  In addition, the Council intends to interpret “nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors” as including any nonbank financial company that acquires, directly or indirectly, a majority of the assets or liabilities of a company that is subject to a final determination of the Council.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-12" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-12">12</a>] </sup>  The Council intends to interpret the term “material financial distress” as a nonbank financial company being in imminent danger of insolvency or defaulting on its financial obligations. The Council intends to interpret the term “threat to the financial stability of the United States” as meaning the threat of an impairment of financial intermediation or of financial market functioning that would be sufficient to inflict severe damage on the broader economy. For purposes of considering whether a nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability under either Determination Standard, the Council intends to assess the company in the context of a period of overall stress in the financial services industry and in a weak macroeconomic environment, with market developments such as increased counterparty defaults, decreased funding availability, and decreased asset prices. The Council believes this is appropriate because in such a context, the risks posed by a nonbank financial company may have a greater effect on U.S. financial stability. </p>


<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Dodd-Frank Act requires the Council to consider 10 specific considerations when determining whether a nonbank financial company satisfies either of the Determination Standards. These statutory considerations help the Council to evaluate whether one of the Determination Standards has been met:<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-13" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-13">13</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• The extent of the leverage of the company; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the extent and nature of the off-balance-sheet exposures of the company; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the extent and nature of the transactions and relationships of the company with other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the importance of the company as a source of credit for households, businesses, and state and local governments and as a source of liquidity for the U.S. financial system; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the importance of the company as a source of credit for low-income, minority, or underserved communities, and the impact that the failure of such company would have on the availability of credit in such communities; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the company, and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the activities of the company; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the degree to which the company is already regulated by one or more primary financial regulatory agencies; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the amount and nature of the financial assets of the company; and </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• the amount and types of the liabilities of the company, including the degree of reliance on short-term funding. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The statute also requires the Council to take into account any other risk-related factors that the Council deems appropriate. Any determination by the Council will be made based on a company-specific evaluation and an application of the standards and considerations set forth in section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and taking into account qualitative and quantitative information the Council deems relevant to a particular nonbank financial company. The Council anticipates that the information relevant to an in-depth analysis of a nonbank financial company may vary based on the nonbank financial company's characteristics. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The discussion below describes how the Council will apply the Determination Standards in its evaluation of a nonbank financial company, including how the Council will take into account the statutory considerations, and other risk-related factors that the Council will take into account. Due to the unique threat that each nonbank financial company could pose to U.S. financial stability and the nature of the inquiry required by the statutory considerations, the Council expects that its evaluations of nonbank financial companies will be firm-specific and may include quantitative and qualitative information that the Council deems relevant to a particular nonbank financial company. The transmission channels, sample metrics, and other factors set forth below are not exhaustive and may not apply to all nonbank financial companies under evaluation. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 III.b.">b. Transmission Channels </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council's evaluation of any nonbank financial company under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act will seek to determine whether a nonbank financial company meets one of the Determination Standards described above. In its analysis of a nonbank financial company, the Council will assess how the negative effects of the company's material financial distress, or of the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the company's activities, could be transmitted to or affect other firms or markets, thereby causing a broader impairment of financial intermediation or of financial market functioning. Such a transmission of risk can occur through various mechanisms, or channels. The Council has identified three transmission channels as most likely to facilitate the transmission of the negative effects of a nonbank financial company's material financial distress, or of the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the company's activities, to other financial firms and markets: Exposure; asset liquidation; and critical function or service. These three transmission channels are described below. The Council may also consider other relevant channels through which risks could be transmitted from a particular nonbank financial company and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. The Council will take into account the 10 statutory considerations and any other risk-related factors the Council deems appropriate as part of its evaluation of a nonbank financial company under the three transmission channels and the other factors described below. Further, in its analyses under the transmission channels, the Council will consider applicable factors that may limit the transmission of risk, such as existing regulatory requirements, collateralization, bankruptcy-remote structures, or guarantee funds that reduce counterparties' exposures to the nonbank financial company or mitigate incentives for customers or counterparties to withdraw funding or assets. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Exposure Transmission Channel </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Under this transmission channel, the Council will evaluate whether a nonbank financial company's creditors, counterparties, investors, or other market participants have direct or indirect exposure to the nonbank financial company that is significant enough to materially and adversely affect those or other creditors, counterparties, investors, or other market participants and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council expects that its analyses under the exposure transmission channel will generally include the factors described below. The potential threat to U.S. financial stability will generally be greater if the amounts of the exposures are larger; if the terms of the transactions provide less protection for the counterparty; and if the largest counterparties include large financial institutions. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council also will consider a company's leverage and size. A company's leverage can amplify the risks posed by exposures, including off-balance sheet exposures, by reducing the company's ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors in the event of its material financial distress. Size is relevant to this analysis, as material financial distress at a larger nonbank financial company would generally transmit risk on a larger scale than distress at a smaller company. Size may be measured by the assets, liabilities, and capital of the firm. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">As required by statute, the Council will consider the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the company and the extent to which ownership of assets under management is diffuse. The Council's analysis will recognize the distinct nature of exposure risks when the company is acting as an agent rather than as principal.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-14" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-14">14</a>] </sup>  In particular, in the case of a nonbank financial company that manages assets on behalf of customers or other third parties, the third parties' direct financial exposures are often to the issuers of the managed assets, rather than to the nonbank financial company managing those assets. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council will consider the exposures that counterparties and other market participants have to a nonbank financial company arising from the company's capital markets activities. This assessment includes an evaluation of the company's relationships with other significant nonbank financial companies and significant bank holding companies. In most cases, the Council will consider factors such as the amount and nature of, and counterparties to, the company's: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Outstanding debt (regardless of term) and other liabilities (such as guaranteed investment contracts issued by an insurance company or Federal Home Loan Bank loans). </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Derivatives transactions (which may be measured on the basis of gross notional amount, net fair value, or potential future exposures). </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Securities financing transactions (<em>i.e.,</em> repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions). </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Lines of credit. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Credit-default swaps outstanding for which the company or an affiliate is the reference entity (generally focusing on single-name credit-default swaps). </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Relevant metrics may include the number, size, and financial strength of a nonbank financial company's counterparties, including the proportion of its counterparties' exposure to the nonbank financial company relative to the counterparties' capital. The potential risk arising under this transmission channel depends not only on the number of counterparties that a nonbank financial company has, but also on the importance of that nonbank financial company to its counterparties and the extent to which the counterparties are interconnected with other financial firms, the financial system, and the broader economy. Therefore, the Council will focus on exposures of large financial institutions to the nonbank financial company under review. This analysis will take into account both individual counterparty exposures as well as aggregate exposures of other financial institutions to the company under review. The amount and types of other exposures that counterparties and other market participants have to a nonbank financial company is highly dependent on the nature of the company's business. The Council's analysis will take these other fact-specific considerations into account. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council also will consider applicable factors, including existing regulatory requirements, that may mitigate potential risks under the exposure transmission channel. For example, collateralization by high-quality, highly liquid securities, such as U.S. Treasury securities, the use of insurance funds to limit counterparty exposures, or other transactions that reallocate risk to well-capitalized entities, may reduce the potential for certain exposures to serve as a channel for the transmission of risk. </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Contagion)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Contagion)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 III.b. “Contagion”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">Contagion.</em>   The negative effects of the material financial distress of a large, interconnected nonbank financial company are not necessarily limited to the amount of direct losses suffered by the firm's creditors, counterparties, investors, or other market participants. In general, the wider and more interconnected a company's network of financial counterparties, the greater the potential negative effect of the material financial distress of the company. Aggregate exposures to a nonbank financial company can create a potential threat to U.S. financial stability if they lead to contagion among financial institutions and financial markets more broadly. Contagion has the potential to spread distress quickly and seemingly unexpectedly. Such transmission is associated with opaque balance sheets, closely correlated markets, and coordination failures among investors. In such circumstances, fire sales by a highly leveraged and interconnected nonbank financial company may result in a loss of confidence in other financial companies that are perceived to have similar characteristics. The Council will seek evidence regarding the potential for contagion, including relevant industry-specific historical examples and the scope of the company's interconnectedness with large financial institutions, among other factors. Various market-based or regulatory factors can strongly mitigate the risk of contagion. Contagion should be viewed in conjunction with other factors described above when evaluating risk under the exposure transmission channel. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Asset Liquidation Transmission Channel </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Under this transmission channel, the Council will consider whether a nonbank financial company holds assets that, if liquidated quickly, could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability by, for example, causing a fall in asset prices that significantly disrupts trading or funding in key markets or causes significant losses or funding problems for other firms with similar holdings. This channel would likely be most relevant for a nonbank financial company that could be forced to liquidate assets quickly due to its funding and liquid asset profile. For example, this could be the case if a nonbank financial company relies heavily on short-term funding. The Council may also consider whether a deterioration in asset pricing or market functioning could pressure other financial firms to sell their holdings of affected assets in order to maintain adequate capital and liquidity, which, in turn, could produce a cycle of asset sales that could lead to further market disruptions. This analysis includes an assessment of any maturity mismatch at the company—the difference between the maturities of the company's assets and liabilities. A company's reliance on short-term funding to finance longer-term positions can subject the company to rollover or refinancing risk that may force it to sell assets rapidly at low market prices. The Council will also consider applicable factors that may mitigate potential risks under the asset liquidation transmission channel. As part of its analysis, the Council will consider the extent to which assets are managed rather than owned by the company. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">The Council's analyses of the asset liquidation transmission channel will focus on three central factors, described below. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Liquidity%20of%20the%20companys%20liabilities)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Liquidity%20of%20the%20companys%20liabilities)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 III.b. “Liquidity of the company's liabilities”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">Liquidity of the company's liabilities.</em>   The first factor in the Council's assessment under this transmission channel is the amount and nature of the company's liabilities that are, or could become, short-term in nature. This analysis involves an assessment of the company's liquidity risk. Liquidity risk generally refers to the risk that a company may not have sufficient funding to satisfy its short-term needs. For example, relevant factors may include: </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• The company's short-term financial obligations (including outstanding commercial paper). </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Financial arrangements that can be terminated by counterparties and therefore become short-term (including callable debt, derivatives, securities lending, repurchase agreements, and off-balance-sheet exposures). </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Long-term liabilities that may come due in a short-term period. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Financial transactions that may require the company to provide additional margin or collateral to the counterparty. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Products that allow customers rapidly to withdraw funds from the company. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Liabilities related to other collateralized borrowings and deposits. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">The Council will quantitatively identify the scale of potential liquidity needs that could plausibly arise at the company. As part of this analysis, the Council will apply counterparty and customer withdrawal rates based on historical examples and other relevant models to assess the scope of plausible withdrawals. In addition, any ability of the company or its financial regulators to impose stays on counterparty terminations or withdrawals is relevant, because it may reduce the company's liquidity needs in an event of material financial distress. The Council also will consider the company's internal estimates of potential liquidity needs in a context of material financial distress. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">The company's leverage and short-term debt ratios are relevant to this analysis, as high leverage and reliance on short-term funding can increase the potential for a company to be subject to sudden liquidity strains that force it rapidly to sell assets. Leverage can be measured by the ratio of assets to capital or as a measure of economic risk relative to capital. The latter measurement can better capture the effect of derivatives and other products with embedded leverage on the risk undertaken by a nonbank financial company. Comparisons of leverage to peer financial institutions can help indicate the level of risk at the company. Metrics that may be used to assess leverage include: </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Total assets and total debt measured relative to total equity, which measures financial leverage. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Derivatives liabilities and off-balance sheet obligations relative to total equity, which may show how much off-balance sheet leverage a nonbank financial company may have. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Securities financing transactions and funding agreements that provide alternative sources of liquidity or operating income, which indicate the use of operating leverage. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Changes in leverage ratios, which may indicate that a nonbank financial company is increasing or decreasing its risk profile. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Liquidity%20of%20the%20companys%20assets)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Liquidity%20of%20the%20companys%20assets)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 III.b. “Liquidity of the company's assets”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">Liquidity of the company's assets.</em>   The second factor under the asset liquidation transmission channel is an analysis of the company's assets that the company could rapidly liquidate, if necessary, to satisfy its obligations. In particular, the Council expects that this assessment will focus on the size and liquidity characteristics of the company's investment portfolio. The Council will assess the company's assets, grouped into categories such as highly liquid (for example, cash, U.S. Treasury securities, and U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities) and less-liquid (for example, corporate bonds, non-agency mortgage-backed securities, and mortgages and other loans) to determine if it holds cash instruments or readily marketable securities that could reasonably be expected to have a liquid market in times of broader market stress. To the extent that the company's assets are encumbered, those assets would generally not be considered to be available to satisfy short-term obligations. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Potential%20fire%20sale%20impacts)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(b.)(Potential%20fire%20sale%20impacts)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 III.b. “Potential fire sale impacts”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">Potential fire sale impacts.</em>   The third factor in the asset liquidation transmission channel analysis is the potential effects of the company's asset liquidation on markets and market participants. As described above, the Council will assess the scale of potential liquidity needs that could plausibly arise at the company and the amount and nature of financial assets the company could sell to satisfy its obligations. In this step of the asset liquidation transmission channel analysis, the Council will apply quantitative models to assess how the company could satisfy the identified range of potential liquidity needs by rapidly selling its identified liquid assets. To assess this factor, the Council will compare the volume of the company's potential liquidation of particular categories of financial instruments with the average daily trading volume in the United States of those types of instruments. In general, a rapid liquidation of a significant amount of relatively illiquid financial instruments, or instruments that are widely held by other market participants, will have a greater effect on the market than a liquidation of the same amount of highly liquid instruments or instruments that are not widely held. The Council may also conduct an analysis to assess the relative impact of negative shocks to the equity or assets of certain financial institutions on other financial institutions. The Council expects that its analysis will generally focus on potential asset liquidation periods of 30 to 90 days. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">The order in which a nonbank financial company may liquidate assets is a factor in the extent of any fire sale risk, but is subject to considerable uncertainties. A company could liquidate a significant portion of its highly liquid assets first, in order to reduce the likelihood that the company would be forced to liquidate illiquid assets in the event of its material financial distress. However, in the event of the company's material financial distress, a company may also be expected to seek to maintain compliance with any applicable risk-based capital ratios and other requirements. Doing so might require a company to sell a mix of assets across a number of asset classes, rather than proceed with the sale of assets in order from most liquid to least liquid. Further, in the event of a significant market disruption, there could be a meaningful first-mover advantage to selling less-liquid assets first. For example, markets for less-liquid assets, such as private and public corporate bonds and asset-backed securities, could be prone to disruption in the event that a seller liquidated a large portion of its portfolio of those assets. Given these potential discounts, in some circumstances a company may be incentivized to sell a portion of its less-liquid assets first and to hold U.S. government securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, which tend to increase in value during a period of market turmoil. To the extent that a company's highly liquid assets are encumbered (for example, under securities financing transactions or as collateral for loans), the company would also need to sell less-liquid assets to satisfy its liquidity needs. Further, a company's holdings of liquid assets could be reduced before the company enters material financial distress. As a result, the Council may take into account company-specific factors in assessing the order in which the company might liquidate assets. One approach the Council may take is to assess the potential effects if the company sells pro rata portions of the more-liquid segments of its investment portfolio (such as cash and highly liquid instruments, U.S. agency securities, investment-grade public corporate debt securities, publicly traded equity securities, and asset backed-securities). </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Critical Function or Service Transmission Channel </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Under this transmission channel, the Council will consider the potential for a nonbank financial company to become unable or unwilling to provide a critical function or service that is relied upon by market participants and for which there are no ready substitutes and thereby pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. This factor is commonly referred to as “substitutability.” Substitutability captures the extent to which other firms could provide similar financial services in a timely manner at a similar price and quantity if a nonbank financial company withdraws from a particular market. Substitutability also captures situations in which a nonbank financial company is the primary or dominant provider of services in a market that the Council determines to be essential to U.S. financial stability. A risk under this transmission channel may be identified if a company provides a critical function or service that may not easily be substitutable. The Council's analysis will also consider applicable factors that may mitigate potential risks under the critical function or service transmission channel. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Concern about a potential lack of substitutability could be greater if a nonbank financial company and its competitors are likely to experience stress at the same time because they are exposed to the same risks. The Council may also analyze the nonbank financial company's activities and critical functions and the importance of those activities and functions to the U.S. financial system and assess how those activities and functions would be performed by the nonbank financial company or other market participants in the event of the nonbank financial company's material financial distress. The Council also will consider the substitutability of critical market functions that the company provides in the United States in the event of material financial distress of a foreign parent company. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">The analysis of this channel incorporates a review of the competitive landscape for markets in which a nonbank financial company participates and for the services it provides (including the provision of liquidity to the U.S. financial system, the provision of credit to low-income, minority, or underserved communities, or the provision of credit to households, businesses and state and local governments), the ability of other firms to replace those services, and the nonbank financial company's market share. This analysis may focus on the company's market share in specific product lines and the ability of substitutes to replace a service or function provided by the company. The Council's evaluation of a nonbank financial company's market share regarding a particular product or service may include assessments of the ability of the nonbank financial company's competitors to expand to meet market needs during a period of overall stress in the financial services industry or in a weak macroeconomic environment; the costs that market participants would incur if forced to switch providers; the timeframe within which a disruption in the provision of the product or service would materially affect market participants or market functioning; and the economic implications of such a disruption. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-1310(III.)(c.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310 III.c.">c. Complexity and Resolvability </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The potential threat a nonbank financial company could pose to U.S. financial stability may be mitigated or aggravated by the company's complexity, opacity, or resolvability. In particular, a risk may be aggravated if a nonbank financial company's resolution under ordinary insolvency regimes could disrupt key markets or have a material adverse impact on other financial firms or markets. An evaluation of a nonbank financial company's complexity and resolvability entails an assessment of (1) the complexity of the nonbank financial company's legal, funding, and operational structure, and (2) any obstacles to the rapid and orderly resolution of the nonbank financial company: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Legal structure factors may include the number of jurisdictions the company operates in, the number of subsidiaries, and the organizational structure. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Funding structure factors may include the degree of interaffiliate dependency for liquidity and funding (such as intercompany loans or other affiliate support arrangements), payment operation (such as treasury operations), and risk-management. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Operational structure factors may include the number of employees, the number of U.S. and non-U.S. locations, and the degree of inter-company dependency in regard to financial guarantees and support arrangements, the ability to separate functions and spin off services or business lines, the complexity and resiliency of intercompany and outsourced services and arrangements in resolution, and the likelihood of preserving franchise value in a recovery or resolution scenario. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Cross-border operational factors may include size and complexity of the company's cross-border operations and impact of potential ring-fencing on an orderly resolution. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Factors that would tend to increase the risk associated with a company's complexity and resolvability include large size or scope of activities; a complex legal or operational structure; multi-jurisdictional operations and regulatory regimes; complex funding structures; the potential impact of a loss of key personnel; and shared services among affiliates. The opacity of a firm's structure—if the firm's structure and operations cannot readily or easily be determined—may present an obstacle to resolution. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">As noted above, one of the considerations the Council is statutorily required to take into account in making a determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act is the degree to which the nonbank financial company is already regulated by one or more primary financial regulatory agencies.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-15" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-15">15</a>] </sup>  In its analysis of this statutory consideration, the Council will focus on the extent to which existing regulation of the company has mitigated the potential risks to financial stability identified by the Council. For example, factors that may be used to assess existing regulatory scrutiny include: </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• The extent to which the company's primary financial regulator has imposed risk-management standards such as capital, liquidity, and reporting requirements, as relevant to the type of company, and has authority to supervise, examine, and bring enforcement actions, with respect to the company and its affiliates. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Regulators' processes for inter-regulator coordination. </p>

When possible, the Council will quantify reasonably estimable benefits and costs, using ranges, as appropriate, and based on empirical data when available. If such benefits or costs cannot be quantified in this manner, the Council will explain why such benefits or costs could not be quantified. The Council also expects to consider benefits and costs qualitatively.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-17" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-17">17</a>] </sup>  To the extent feasible, the Council will attempt to assess the relative importance of any such qualitative elements. The Council will make a determination under section 113 only if the expected benefits to financial stability from Federal Reserve supervision and prudential standards justify the expected costs that the determination would impose. As part of this analysis, the Council will assess the likelihood of a firm's material financial distress, in order to assess the extent to which a determination may promote U.S. financial stability. </p>


<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The key elements of regulatory analysis include (1) a statement of the need for the proposed action, (2) an examination of alternative approaches, and (3) an evaluation of the benefits and costs (quantitative and qualitative) of the proposed action and the main alternatives.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-18" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-18">18</a>] </sup>  The Council will conduct this analysis only in cases where the Council is concluding that the company meets one of the standards for a determination by the Council under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act, because in other cases doing so would not affect the outcome of the Council's analysis. </p>

<p class="indent-4 no-hierarchy">One of the Council's statutory purposes is to respond to emerging threats to the stability of the U.S. financial system.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-19" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-19">19</a>] </sup>  The primary intended benefit of a determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act is a reduction in the likelihood or severity of a financial crisis. Therefore, the Council will consider potential benefits to the U.S. financial system and the U.S. economy arising from a Council determination. To the extent that a Council determination reduces the likelihood or severity of a potential financial crisis, the determination could enhance financial stability and mitigate the severity of economic downturns. The Council may use various measures of systemic risk to assess any improvement in financial stability. Such measures include S-Risk (which attempts to quantify the amount of capital a financial firm would need to raise in order to function normally in the event of a severe financial crisis), conditional value at risk, and certain estimates of fire sale risk, among others. To assess the benefit to the U.S. financial system and the U.S. economy from a determination, the Council may also consider historical analogues to the nonbank under review. In addition, the Council may compare the risks to financial stability posed by a particular nonbank to the risks posed by large bank holding companies, in order to produce an assessment of the relative risks the company may pose. Further, the loss of any implicit “too big to fail” or similar subsidy would be considered a benefit to the economy, even if it increases the nonbank financial company's cost of capital. </p>

<p class="indent-4 no-hierarchy">Analysis of the benefits of a determination for the relevant nonbank financial company may include those arising directly from the Council's determination as well as any benefits arising from anticipated new or increased requirements resulting from the determination, such as additional supervision and enhanced capital, liquidity, or risk-management requirements. For example, a nonbank financial company subject to a Council determination may benefit from a lower cost of capital or higher credit ratings upon meeting its post-determination regulatory requirements. </p>

<p class="indent-4 no-hierarchy">• Increased capital requirements, after accounting for offsetting benefits to taxpayers and to the holders of the firm's other liabilities. </p>
<p class="indent-4 no-hierarchy">• Liquidity requirements, such as the opportunity cost from any requirement to hold additional high-quality liquid assets, relative to the company's current investment portfolio. </p>
<p class="indent-4 no-hierarchy">Because the Federal Reserve is required to tailor prudential standards to a nonbank financial company subject to a Council determination after the Council has made a determination regarding the company, the new regulatory requirements that result from the Council's determination will not be known to the Council during its analysis of the company. In cases where the nonbank financial company under review primarily engages in bank-like activities, the Council may consider, as a proxy, the costs that would be imposed on the nonbank if the Federal Reserve imposed prudential standards similar to those imposed on bank holding companies with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-20" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-20">20</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="indent-4 no-hierarchy">The Council also will consider the cost of a determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act to the U.S. economy by assessing the impact of the determination on the availability and cost of credit or financial products in relevant U.S. markets. To the extent that the markets in which the relevant nonbank participates have low concentration, the impact that the determination regarding one firm would have on credit conditions would generally be immaterial. However, if the relevant markets are concentrated, a Council determination regarding a significant market participant could have a material impact on credit conditions in that market. As part of this analysis, the Council may also consider the extent to which any reduction in financial services provided by the nonbank financial company under review would be offset by other market participants. </p>

For example, these factors may include leverage (both on- and off-balance sheet), potential risks associated with asset reevaluations (whether such reevaluations arise from market disruptions or severe macroeconomic conditions), reliance on short-term funding or other fragile funding markets, maturity transformation, and risks from exposures to counterparties or other market participants. This assessment may rely upon historical examples regarding the characteristics of financial companies that have experienced financial distress, but may also consider other risks that do not have historical precedent. The Council's analysis of the vulnerability of a nonbank financial company to material financial distress will be conducted taking into account a period of overall stress in the financial services industry and a weak macroeconomic environment. The Council may also consider the results of any stress tests that have previously been conducted by the company or by its primary financial regulatory agency. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">As described in section II above, the Council will prioritize an activities-based approach for identifying, assessing, and addressing potential risks to financial stability. However, if a potential risk or threat to U.S. financial stability cannot be adequately addressed through an activities-based approach, the Council may consider a nonbank financial company for a potential determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Council anticipates it would consider a nonbank financial company for a potential determination under section 113 only in rare instances, such as if the products, activities, or practices of a company that pose a potential threat to U.S. financial stability are outside the jurisdiction or authority of financial regulatory agencies. The Council expects generally to follow a two-stage process of evaluation and analysis, as described below. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In the first stage of the process (“Stage 1”), nonbank financial companies identified as potentially posing risks to U.S. financial stability will be notified and subject to a preliminary analysis, based on quantitative and qualitative information available to the Council primarily through public and regulatory sources. During Stage 1, the Council will permit, but not require, the company to submit relevant information. The Council will also consult with the primary financial regulatory agency or home country supervisor, as appropriate. This approach will enable the Council to fulfill its statutory obligation to rely whenever possible on information available through the Office of Financial Research (the “OFR”), Council member agencies, or the nonbank financial company's primary financial regulatory agencies before requiring the submission of reports from any nonbank financial company.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-21" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-21">21</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Following Stage 1, nonbank financial companies that are selected for additional review will receive notice that they are being considered for a proposed determination that the company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability (a “Proposed Determination”) and will be subject to in-depth evaluation during the second stage of review (“Stage 2”). Stage 2 will involve the evaluation of additional information collected directly from the nonbank financial company. At the end of Stage 2, the Council may consider whether to make a Proposed Determination with respect to the nonbank financial company. If a Proposed Determination is made by the Council, the nonbank financial company may request a hearing in accordance with section 113(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act and <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1310.21#p-1310.21(c)" class="cfr external">§ 1310.21(c)</a> of the Council's rule.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-22" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-22">22</a>] </sup>  After making a Proposed Determination and holding any written or oral hearing if requested, the Council may vote to make a final determination. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Stage 1 involves a preliminary analysis of nonbank financial companies to assess the risks they could pose to U.S. financial stability. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Identification of Company for Review in Stage 1 </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">If, as described in section II, the Council's consultation with and any recommendations to a nonbank financial company's primary financial regulatory agency do not adequately address a potential risk identified by the Council, the Council may evaluate one or more individual nonbank financial companies for an entity-specific determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Council will vote to commence review of a nonbank financial company in Stage 1. When evaluating the potential risks associated with a nonbank financial company, the Council may consider the company and its subsidiaries together. This approach enables the Council to consider potential risks arising across the consolidated organization, while retaining the ability to make a determination regarding either the parent or any individual nonbank financial company subsidiary (or neither), depending on which entity the Council determines could pose a threat to financial stability. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Engagement With Company and Regulators in Stage 1 </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council will provide a notice to any nonbank financial company under review in Stage 1. In Stage 1, the Council will consider available public and regulatory information; in addition, a company under review in Stage 1 may submit to the Council any information it deems relevant to the Council's evaluation and may, upon request, meet with staff of Council members and member agencies who are leading the Council's analysis. In order to reduce the burdens of review on the company, the Council will not require the company to submit information during Stage 1. In addition, staff representing Council members will, upon request, provide the company with a list of the primary public sources of information being considered during the Stage 1 analysis, so that the company has an opportunity to understand the information the Council may rely upon during Stage 1. Through this engagement, the Council will seek to enable the company under review to understand the focus of the Council's analysis, which may enable the company to act to mitigate any risks to financial stability and thereby potentially avoid becoming subject to a Council determination. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">During the discussions in Stage 1 with the company, the Council intends for staff of Council members and member agencies to explain to the company the key risks that have been identified in the analysis. Because the review of the company is preliminary and continues to change until the Council makes a final determination, these identified risks may shift over time. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council will also consider in Stage 1 information available from relevant existing regulators of the company. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Council is required to consult with the primary financial regulatory agency, if any, for each nonbank financial company or subsidiary of a nonbank financial company that is being considered for a determination before the Council makes any final determination with respect to such company.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-23" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-23">23</a>] </sup>  For any company under review in Stage 1 that is regulated by a primary financial regulatory agency or home country supervisor, the Council will notify the regulator or supervisor that the company is under review no later than such time as the company is notified. As part of that consultation process, the Council will consult with the primary financial regulatory agency, if any, of each significant subsidiary of the nonbank financial company, to the extent the Council deems appropriate in Stage 1. The Council will actively solicit the regulator's views regarding risks at the company and potential mitigants. In order to enable the regulator to provide relevant information, the Council will share its preliminary views regarding potential risks at the company, and request that the regulator provide information regarding those specific risks, including whether the risks are adequately mitigated by factors such as existing regulation or the company's business practices. During the determination process, the Council will continue to encourage the regulator to address any risks to U.S. financial stability using the regulator's existing authorities; if the Council believes the regulator's actions adequately address the potential risks to U.S. financial stability the Council has identified, the Council may discontinue its consideration of the firm for a potential determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Based on the preliminary evaluation in Stage 1, the Council may vote to commence a more detailed analysis of the company by advancing the company to Stage 2, or it may decide not to evaluate the company further. If the Council determines not to advance a company that has been reviewed in Stage 1 to Stage 2, the Council will notify the company in writing of the Council's decision. The notice will clarify that a decision not to advance the company from Stage 1 to Stage 2 at that time does not preclude the Council from reinitiating review of the company in Stage 1. For example, the Council may reinitiate review of the company if material changes affecting the firm merit further evaluation. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Stage 2 involves an in-depth evaluation of any company that the Council has determined merits additional review. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">In Stage 2, the Council will review the relevant company using information collected directly from the nonbank financial company, through the OFR, as well as public and regulatory information. The review will focus on whether the nonbank financial company could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability because of the company's material financial distress or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the activities of the company. The Council expects that the transmission channels and the other factors described above will be used to evaluate a nonbank financial company's potential to pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Engagement With Company and Regulators in Stage 2 </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Each nonbank financial company to be evaluated in Stage 2 will receive a notice (a “Notice of Consideration”) that the nonbank financial company is under consideration for a Proposed Determination. The Council also will submit to the company a request that the company provide information that the Council deems relevant to the Council's evaluation, and the nonbank financial company will be provided an opportunity to submit written materials to the Council.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-24" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-24">24</a>] </sup>  This information will generally be collected by the OFR. Before requiring the submission of reports from any nonbank financial company that is regulated by a Council member agency or any primary financial regulatory agency, the Council, acting through the OFR, will coordinate with such agencies and will, whenever possible, rely on information available from the OFR or such agencies. Council members and their agencies and staffs will maintain the confidentiality of such information in accordance with applicable law. During Stage 2, the company may also submit any other information that it deems relevant to the Council's evaluation. Information considered by the Council includes details regarding the company's financial activities, legal structure, liabilities, counterparty exposures, resolvability, and existing regulatory oversight. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Information requests likely will involve both qualitative and quantitative data. Information relevant to the Council's analysis may include confidential business information such as detailed information regarding financial assets, terms of funding arrangements, counterparty exposure or position data, strategic plans, and interaffiliate transactions. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Council will make staff representing Council members available to meet with the representatives of any company that enters Stage 2, to explain the evaluation process and the framework for the Council's analysis. If the analysis in Stage 1 has identified specific aspects of the company's operations or activities as the primary focus for the evaluation, staff will notify the company of those issues, although the issues will be subject to change based on the ongoing analysis. In addition, the Council expects that its Deputies Committee<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footnote-25" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-1310-footref-25">25</a>] </sup>  will grant a request to meet with a company in Stage 2 to allow the company to present any information or arguments it deems relevant to the Council's evaluation. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">During Stage 2 the Council will also seek to continue its consultation with the company's primary financial regulatory agency or home country supervisor in a timely manner before the Council makes any proposed or final determination with respect to such nonbank financial company. The Council will continue to encourage the regulator during the determination process to address any risks to U.S. financial stability using the regulator's existing authorities; as noted above, if the Council believes the regulator's actions adequately address the potential risks to U.S. financial stability the Council has identified, the Council may discontinue its consideration of the firm for a potential determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Before making a Proposed Determination regarding a nonbank financial company, the Council will notify the company when the Council believes that the evidentiary record regarding such nonbank financial company is complete. The Council will notify any nonbank financial company in Stage 2 if the nonbank financial company ceases to be considered for a determination. Any nonbank financial company that ceases to be considered at any time in the Council's determination process may be considered for a Proposed Determination in the future at the Council's discretion, consistent with the processes described above. </p>

<p>The Council applies the same standards of review in its annual reevaluations as the standard for an initial determination regarding a nonbank financial company: Either the company's material financial distress, or the nature, scope, size, scale, concentration, interconnectedness, or mix of the company's activities, could pose a threat to U.S. financial stability. If the Council determines that the company no longer meets those standards, the Council will rescind its determination. </p>
<p>The Council's annual reevaluations generally assess whether any material changes since the previous reevaluation and since the determination justify a rescission of the determination, based on the same transmission channels and other factors that are considered during a determination decision. The Council expects that its reevaluation process will focus on whether any material changes—including changes at the company, changes in its markets or its regulation, changes in the Council's own analysis, or otherwise—result in the company no longer meeting the standard for a determination. In light of the frequent reevaluations, the Council's analyses will generally focus on changes since the Council's previous review, but the ultimate question the Council will seek to assess is whether changes in the aggregate since the Council's determination regarding the company have caused the company to cease meeting the Determination Standards. The Council expects that its analysis in its annual reevaluations will generally be organized around the three transmission channels described above as well as existing regulatory scrutiny and the company's complexity and resolvability. </p>
<p>Before the Council's annual reevaluation of a determination regarding a nonbank financial company, the Council will provide the company with an opportunity to meet with staff of Council members and member agencies to discuss the scope and process for the review and to present information regarding any change that may be relevant to the threat the company could pose to financial stability. Staff of Council members and member agencies will also be available to meet with the company during the annual reevaluation, at the company's request. In addition, during an annual reevaluation, a company may submit any written information to the Council the company considers relevant to the Council's analysis. During annual reevaluations, companies are encouraged to submit information regarding any changes related to the company's risk profile that mitigate the potential risks previously identified by the Council. Such changes could include updates regarding company restructurings, regulatory developments, market changes, or other factors. If the company has taken steps to address the potential risks previously identified by the Council, the Council will assess whether those risks have been adequately mitigated to merit a rescission of the determination regarding the company. If the company explains in detail potential changes it could make to its business to address the potential risks previously identified by the Council, staff of Council members and member agencies will endeavor to provide their feedback on the extent to which those changes may address the potential risks. </p>
<p>If a company contests the Council's determination during the Council's annual reevaluation, the Council will vote on whether to rescind the determination and provide the company, its primary financial regulatory agency, and the primary financial regulatory agency of its significant subsidiaries with a notice explaining the primary basis for any decision not to rescind the determination. If the Council does not rescind the determination, the written notice provided to the company will address each of the material factors raised by the company in its submissions to the Council contesting the determination during the annual reevaluation. The written notice from the Council will also explain in detail why the Council did not find that the company no longer met the standard for a determination under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In general, due to the sensitive nature of its analyses in annual reevaluations, the Council may not in all cases publicly release the written findings that it provides to the company. </p>
<p>Finally, the Council will provide each nonbank financial company subject to a Council determination with an opportunity for an oral hearing before the Council once every five years at which the company can contest the determination. </p>
