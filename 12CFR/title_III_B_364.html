These Guidelines address standards for developing and implementing administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of customer information. These Guidelines also address standards with respect to the proper disposal of consumer information pursuant to sections 621 and 628 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/1681s" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 1681s</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/1681w" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1681w</a>). </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Millions of Americans, throughout the country, have been victims of identity theft.<sup>7</sup> Identity thieves misuse personal information they obtain from a number of sources, including financial institutions, to perpetrate identity theft. Therefore, financial institutions should take preventative measures to safeguard customer information against attempts to gain unauthorized access to the information. For example, financial institutions should place access controls on customer information systems and conduct background checks for employees who are authorized to access customer information.<sup>8</sup> However, every financial institution should also develop and implement a risk-based response program to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems<sup>9</sup> that occur nonetheless. A response program should be a key part of an institution's information security program.<sup>10</sup> The program should be appropriate to the size and complexity of the institution and the nature and scope of its activities. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In addition, each institution should be able to address incidents of unauthorized access to customer information in customer information systems maintained by its domestic and foreign service providers. Therefore, consistent with the obligations in the Guidelines that relate to these arrangements, and with existing guidance on this topic issued by the Agencies,<sup>11</sup> an institution's contract with its service provider should require the service provider to take appropriate actions to address incidents of unauthorized access to the financial institution's customer information, including notification to the institution as soon as possible of any such incident, to enable the institution to expeditiously implement its response program. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Financial institutions have an affirmative duty to protect their customers' information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying customers of a security incident involving the unauthorized access or use of the customer's information in accordance with the standard set forth below is a key part of that duty. Timely notification of customers is important to manage an institution's reputation risk. Effective notice also may reduce an institution's legal risk, assist in maintaining good customer relations, and enable the institution's customers to take steps to protect themselves against the consequences of identity theft. When customer notification is warranted, an institution may not forgo notifying its customers of an incident because the institution believes that it may be potentially embarrassed or inconvenienced by doing so. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">When a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution should conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines that misuse of its information about a customer has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should notify the affected customer as soon as possible. Customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for the delay. However, the institution should notify its customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere with the investigation. </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Under the Guidelines, an institution must protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Substantial harm or inconvenience is most likely to result from improper access to <em>sensitive customer information</em> because this type of information is most likely to be misused, as in the commission of identity theft. For purposes of this Guidance, <em>sensitive customer information</em> means a customer's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the customer's social security number, driver's license number, account number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the customer's account. <em>Sensitive customer information</em> also includes any combination of components of customer information that would allow someone to log onto or access the customer's account, such as user name or password or password and account number. </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">If a financial institution, based upon its investigation, can determine from its logs or other data precisely which customers' information has been improperly accessed, it may limit notification to those customers with regard to whom the institution determines that misuse of their information has occurred or is reasonably possible. However, there may be situations where the institution determines that a group of files has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify which specific customers' information has been accessed. If the circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the institution to determine that misuse of the information is reasonably possible, it should notify all customers in the group. </p>
