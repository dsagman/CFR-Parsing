<h3>Federal Mutual Charter
</h3>
<p><em>Section 1. Corporate title.</em> The full corporate title of the Federal savings association is ___.
</p>
<p><em>Section 2. Office.</em> The home office is located in ___ [city, state].
</p>
<p><em>Section 3. Duration.</em> The duration of the association is perpetual.
</p>
<p><em>Section 4. Purpose and powers.</em> The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal mutual savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).
</p>
<p><em>Section 5. Capital.</em> The association may raise capital by accepting payments on savings and demand accounts and by any other means authorized by the OCC.
</p>
<p><em>Section 6. Members.</em> All holders of the association's savings, demand, or other authorized accounts are members of the association. In the consideration of all questions requiring action by the members of the association, each holder of an account is permitted to cast one vote for each $100, or fraction thereof, of the withdrawal value of the member's account. No member, however, may cast more than 1,000 votes. All accounts are nonassessable.
</p>
<p><em>Section 7. Directors.</em> The association is under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen persons, as fixed in the association's bylaws, except that the number of directors may be decreased to a number less than five or increased to a number greater than fifteen with the prior approval of the OCC.
</p>
<p><em>Section 8. Capital, surplus, and distribution of earnings.</em> The association will maintain for the purpose of meeting losses the amount of capital required by section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and by regulations of the OCC. The association will distribute net earnings on its accounts on such basis and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may from time to time be authorized by the OCC: <em>Provided,</em> That the association may establish minimum-balance requirements for accounts to be eligible for distribution of earnings. All holders of accounts of the association will be entitled to equal distribution of assets, <em>pro rata</em> to the value of their accounts, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association. Moreover, in any such event, or in any other situation in which the priority of such accounts is in controversy, all such accounts will, to the extent of their withdrawal value, be debts of the association having the same priority as the claims of general creditors of the association not having priority (other than any priority arising or resulting from consensual subordination) over other general creditors of the association.
</p>
<p><em>Section 9. Amendment of charter.</em> Adoption of any preapproved charter amendment will be effective after such preapproved amendment has been approved by the members at a legal meeting. Any other amendment, addition, change, or repeal of this charter must be approved by the OCC prior to approval by the members at a legal meeting, and will be effective upon filing with the OCC in accordance with regulatory procedures.

<h3>Federal Stock Charter
</h3>
<p><em>Section 1. Corporate title.</em> The full corporate title of the association is __.
</p>
<p><em>Section 2. Office.</em> The home office is located in __ [city, state].
</p>
<p><em>Section 3. Duration.</em> The duration of the association is perpetual.
</p>
<p><em>Section 4. Purpose and powers.</em> The purpose of the association is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a Federal savings association chartered under section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act and to exercise all of the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and by all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”).
</p>
<p><em>Section 5. Capital stock.</em> The total number of shares of all classes of the capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is ____, all of which is common stock of par [or if no par is specified then shares have a stated] value of ____per share. The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without the approval of its shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares must be paid in full before their issuance and may not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services may constitute payment or part payment for the issuance of shares of the association. The consideration for the shares must be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be permitted to the association), labor, or services actually performed for the association, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of directors of the association, is conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration, such shares are deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend is deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.
</p>
<p>Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the association or in connection with the conversion of the association from the mutual to stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) may be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless the issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting. The holders of the common stock exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter provides that there will be no such cumulative voting. Subject to any provision for a liquidation account, in the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock will be entitled, after payment or provision for payment of all debts and liabilities of the association, to receive the remaining assets of the association available for distribution, in cash or in kind. Each share of common stock must have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.
</p>
<p><em>Section 6. Preemptive rights.</em> Holders of the capital stock of the association are not entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares of the association which may be issued.
</p>
<p><em>Section 7. Directors.</em> The association will be under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors, as stated in the association's bylaws, may not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen except when a greater or lesser number is approved by the OCC.
</p>
<p><em>Section 8. Amendment of charter.</em> Except as provided in Section 5, no amendment, addition, alteration, change or repeal of this charter may be made, unless such is proposed by the board of directors of the association, approved by the shareholders by a majority of the votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting, unless a higher vote is otherwise required, and approved or preapproved by the OCC.

<p><em>Section 5. Capital stock.</em> The total number of shares of all classes of capital stock that the association has the authority to issue is ____, of which ____is common stock of par [or if no par value is specified the stated] value of ____per share and of which [list the number of each class of preferred and the par or if no par value is specified the stated value per share of each such class]. The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without further approval of shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this Section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares must be paid in full before their issuance and may not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services may constitute payment or part payment for the issuance of shares of the association.

In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the association that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend will be deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.
</p>
<p>Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the association or in connection with the conversion of the association from the mutual to the stock form of capitalization, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) may be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons of the association other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless their issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting.
</p>
<p>Nothing contained in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections hereto) entitles the holders of any class of a series of capital stock to vote as a separate class or series or to more than one vote per share, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there will be no such cumulative voting: <em>Provided,</em> That this restriction on voting separately by class or series does not apply:
</p>
<p>i. To any provision which would authorize the holders of preferred stock, voting as a class or series, to elect some members of the board of directors, less than a majority thereof, in the event of default in the payment of dividends on any class or series of preferred stock;
</p>
<p>ii. To any provision that would require the holders of preferred stock, voting as a class or series, to approve the merger or consolidation of the association with another corporation or the sale, lease, or conveyance (other than by mortgage or pledge) of properties or business in exchange for securities of a corporation other than the association if the preferred stock is exchanged for securities of such other corporation: <em>Provided,</em> That no provision may require such approval for transactions undertaken with the assistance or pursuant to the direction of the OCC or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation;
</p>
<p>iii. To any amendment which would adversely change the specific terms of any class or series of capital stock as set forth in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections hereto), including any amendment which would create or enlarge any class or series ranking prior thereto in rights and preferences. An amendment which increases the number of authorized shares of any class or series of capital stock, or substitutes the surviving association in a merger or consolidation for the association, is not considered to be such an adverse change.
</p>
<p>A description of the different classes and series (if any) of the association's capital stock and a statement of the designations, and the relative rights, preferences, and limitations of the shares of each class of and series (if any) of capital stock are as follows:
</p>
<p>A. <em>Common stock.</em> Except as provided in this Section 5 (or in any supplementary sections thereto) the holders of the common stock exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of the common stock is entitled to one vote for each share held by each holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter otherwise provides that there will be no such cumulative voting.
</p>
<p>Whenever there has been paid, or declared and set aside for payment, to the holders of the outstanding shares of any class of stock having preference over the common stock as to the payment of dividends, the full amount of dividends and of sinking fund, retirement fund, or other retirement payments, if any, to which such holders are respectively entitled in preference to the common stock, then dividends may be paid on the common stock and on any class or series of stock entitled to participate therewith as to dividends out of any assets legally available for the payment of dividends.
</p>
<p>In the event of any liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association, the holders of the common stock (and the holders of any class or series of stock entitled to participate with the common stock in the distribution of assets) will be entitled to receive, in cash or in kind, the assets of the association available for distribution remaining after: (i) Payment or provision for payment of the association's debts and liabilities; (ii) distributions or provision for distributions in settlement of its liquidation account; and (iii) distributions or provision for distributions to holders of any class or series of stock having preference over the common stock in the liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association. Each share of common stock will have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.
</p>
<p>B. <em>Preferred stock.</em> The association may provide in supplementary sections to its charter for one or more classes of preferred stock, which must be separately identified. The shares of any class may be divided into and issued in series, with each series separately designated so as to distinguish the shares thereof from the shares of all other series and classes. The terms of each series must be set forth in a supplementary section to the charter. All shares of the same class must be identical except as to the following relative rights and preferences, as to which there may be variations between different series:
</p>
<p>a. The distinctive serial designation and the number of shares constituting such series;
</p>
<p>b. The dividend rate or the amount of dividends to be paid on the shares of such series, whether dividends are cumulative and, if so, from which date(s), the payment date(s) for dividends, and the participating or other special rights, if any, with respect to dividends;
</p>
<p>c. The voting powers, full or limited, if any, of shares of such series;
</p>
<p>d. Whether the shares of such series are redeemable and, if so, the price(s) at which, and the terms and conditions on which, such shares may be redeemed;
</p>
<p>e. The amount(s) payable upon the shares of such series in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the association;
</p>
<p>f. Whether the shares of such series are entitled to the benefit of a sinking or retirement fund to be applied to the purchase or redemption of such shares, and if so entitled, the amount of such fund and the manner of its application, including the price(s) at which such shares may be redeemed or purchased through the application of such fund;
</p>
<p>g. Whether the shares of such series are convertible into, or exchangeable for, shares of any other class or classes of stock of the association and, if so, the conversion price(s) or the rate(s) of exchange, and the adjustments thereof, if any, at which such conversion or exchange may be made, and any other terms and conditions of such conversion or exchange.
</p>
<p>h. The price or other consideration for which the shares of such series are issued; and
</p>
<p>i. Whether the shares of such series which are redeemed or converted have the status of authorized but unissued shares of serial preferred stock and whether such shares may be reissued as shares of the same or any other series of serial preferred stock.
</p>
<p>Each share of each series of serial preferred stock must have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of the same series.
</p>
<p>The board of directors has authority to divide, by the adoption of supplementary charter sections, any authorized class of preferred stock into series, and, within the limitations set forth in this section and the remainder of this charter, fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of the shares of any series so established.
</p>
<p>Prior to the issuance of any preferred shares of a series established by a supplementary charter section adopted by the board of directors, the association must file with the OCC a dated copy of that supplementary section of this charter established and designating the series and fixing and determining the relative rights and preferences thereof.</p>

</p>
<p>A. <em>Beneficial Ownership Limitation.</em> No person may directly or indirectly offer to acquire or acquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10 percent of any class of an equity security of the association. This limitation does not apply to a transaction in which the association forms a holding company without change in the respective beneficial ownership interests of its stockholders other than pursuant to the exercise of any dissenter and appraisal rights, the purchase of shares by underwriters in connection with a public offering, or the purchase of less than 25 percent of a class of stock by a tax-qualified employee stock benefit plan as defined in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-192.25" class="cfr external">12 CFR 192.25</a>.

</p>
<p>2. The term “offer” includes every offer to buy or otherwise acquire, solicitation of an offer to sell, tender offer for, or request or invitation for tenders of, a security or interest in a security for value.
</p>
<p>3. The term “acquire” includes every type of acquisition, whether effected by purchase, exchange, operation of law or otherwise.
</p>
<p>4. The term “acting in concert” means (a) knowing participation in a joint activity or parallel action towards a common goal of acquiring control whether or not pursuant to an express agreement, or (b) a combination or pooling of voting or other interests in the securities of an issuer for a common purpose pursuant to any contract, understanding, relationship, agreement or other arrangement, whether written or otherwise.

<p>B. <em>Cumulative Voting Limitation.</em> Stockholders may not cumulate their votes for election of directors.

The application also must include a complete description of the bank's investment in the subsidiary, the proposed activities of the subsidiary, the organizational structure and management of the subsidiary, the relations between the bank and the subsidiary, and other information necessary to adequately describe the proposal. To the extent that the application relates to the initial affiliation of the bank with a company engaged in insurance activities, the bank must describe the type of insurance activity in which the company is engaged and has present plans to conduct. The bank must also list for each State the lines of business for which the company holds, or will hold, an insurance license, indicating the State where the company holds a resident license or charter, as applicable. The application must state whether the operating subsidiary will conduct any activity at a location other than the main office or a previously approved branch of the bank. The OCC may require a filer to submit a legal analysis if the proposal is novel, unusually complex, or raises substantial unresolved legal issues. In these cases, the OCC encourages filers to have a prefiling meeting with the OCC. Any bank receiving approval under this paragraph is deemed to have agreed that the subsidiary will conduct the activity in a manner consistent with published OCC guidance. </p>

The dividend is equivalent to a cash dividend in an amount equal to the actual current value of the property, regardless of whether the book value is higher or lower under GAAP.
