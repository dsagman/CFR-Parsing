<p>These rules implement the Equal Access to Justice Act, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/5/504" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5 U.S.C. 504</a> (EAJA). The EAJA provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses to eligible individuals and entities who are parties to certain administrative proceedings (designated by the EAJA as “adversary adjudications”) before Federal agencies. An eligible party may receive an award when it prevails over an agency, unless the agency's position was substantially justified or special circumstances make an award unjust. The rules in this part explain how the EAJA applies to Farm Credit Administration (FCA) proceedings. The rules describe the parties eligible for awards, how such parties may apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that govern FCA consideration of applications. </p>
