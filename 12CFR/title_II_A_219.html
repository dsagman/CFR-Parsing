<p>This subpart of Regulation S (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-219/subpart-B" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 219, subpart B</a>) is issued by the Board under the authority of section 21(b) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1829b" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1829b</a>), as amended by the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102–550, title XV; 106 Stat. 3672, 4044), which authorizes the Board and the Secretary of the Treasury jointly to prescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements for domestic wire transfers by insured depository institutions; and which also requires the Board and the Treasury jointly to prescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements for international wire transfers by insured depository institutions and by nonbank financial institutions. The definitions and recordkeeping and reporting requirements referenced in this subpart are promulgated and administered jointly by the Board and the Treasury and are codified in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-31/section-1010.100" class="cfr external">31 CFR 1010.100</a>, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-31/section-1010.410#p-1010.410(e)" class="cfr external">1010.410(e)</a>, and <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-31/section-1020.410#p-1020.410(a)" class="cfr external">1020.410(a)</a>.
