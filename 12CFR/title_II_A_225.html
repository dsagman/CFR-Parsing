<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.101(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> The question is raised as to whether shares in a nonbanking company which were acquired by a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company many years ago when their acquisition was lawful and are now held as investments, and which do not include more than 5 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such nonbanking company and do not have a value greater than 5 percent of the value of the bank holding company's total assets, are exempted from the divestment requirements of the Act by the provisions of section 4(c)(5) of the Act. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.101(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> In the Board's opinion, this exemption is as applicable to such shares when held by a banking subsidiary of a bank holding company as when held directly by the bank holding company itself. While the exemption specifically refers only to shares held or acquired by the bank holding company, the prohibition of the Act against retention of nonbanking interests applies to indirect as well as direct ownership of shares of a nonbanking company, and, in the absence of a clear mandate to the contrary, any exception to this prohibition should be given equal breadth with the prohibition. Any other interpretation would lead to unwarranted results. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.101(d)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>d<span class="paren">)</span></span> Although certain of the other exemptions in section 4(c) of the Act specifically refer to shares held or acquired by banking subsidiaries, an analysis of those exemptions suggests that such specific reference to banking subsidiaries was for the purpose of excluding nonbanking subsidiaries from such exemptions, rather than for the purpose of providing an inclusionary emphasis on banking subsidiaries. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-225.101(e)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.101(e)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>e<span class="paren">)</span></span> It should be noted that the Board's view as to this question should not be interpreted as meaning that each banking subsidiary could own up to 5 percent of the stock of the same nonbanking organization. In the Board's opinion the limitations set forth in section 4(c)(5) apply to the aggregate amount of stock held in a particular organization by the bank holding company itself and by all of its subsidiaries. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-225.101(f)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.101(f)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>f<span class="paren">)</span></span> Secondly, question is raised as to whether shares in a nonbanking company acquired in satisfaction of debts previously contracted (d.p.c.) by a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company may be retained if such shares meet the conditions contained in section 4(c)(5) as to value and amount, notwithstanding the requirement of section 4(c)(2) that shares acquired d.p.c. be disposed of within two years after the date of their acquisition or the date of the Act, whichever is later. In the Board's opinion, the 5 percent exemption provided by section 4(c)(5) covers any shares, including shares acquired d.p.c., that meet the conditions set forth in that exemption, and, consequently, d.p.c. shares held by a banking subsidiary of a bank holding company which meet such conditions are not subject to the two-year disposition requirement prescribed by section 4(c)(2), although any such shares would, of course, continue to be subject to such requirement for disposition as may be prescribed by provisions of any applicable banking laws or by the appropriate bank supervisory authorities. </p>

<div id="p-225.101(g)"><p class="indent-1" data-title="225.101(g)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>g<span class="paren">)</span></span> Finally, question is raised as to whether shares held by banking subsidiaries of the bank holding company in companies holding bank premises of such subsidiaries are exempted from the divestment requirements by section 4(c)(1) of the Act. It is the Board's view that section 4(c)(1), exempting shares owned or acquired by a bank holding company in any company engaged solely in holding or operating properties used wholly or substantially by any subsidiary bank, is to be read and interpreted, like section 4(c)(5), as applying to shares owned indirectly by a bank holding company through a banking subsidiary as well as to shares held directly by the bank holding company. A contrary interpretation would impair the right that member banks controlled by bank holding companies would otherwise have to invest, subject to the limitations of section 24A of the Federal Reserve Act, in stock of companies holding their bank premises; and such a result was not, in the Board's opinion, intended by the Bank Holding Company Act. </p></div>

All installment paper purchased by Corporation X was sold by it to a bank which is a subsidiary of Holding Company A, without recourse, at a price equal to the cost of the installment paper to Corporation X, and with compensation to the latter based on the earnings from such paper remaining after certain reserves, expenses and charges. The subsidiary bank sold participations in such installment paper to the other affiliated banks of Holding Company A which desired to participate. Purchases by Corporation X consisted mainly of paper insured under title I of the National Housing Act and, in addition, Corporation X purchased time payment contracts covering sales of appliances by dealers under contractual arrangements with utilities, as well as paper covering home improvements which was not insured. Pursuant to certain service agreements, Corporation X made all collections, enforced guaranties, filed claims under title I insurance and performed other services for the affiliated banks.

Corporation Y investigated credit standings of purchasers obligated on time sale contracts to be acquired by Holding Company B, Corporation Y received from dealers the papers offered by them and inspected such papers to see that they were in order, and transmitted to Holding Company B for its determination to purchase, including, in some cases, issuance of drafts in favor of dealers in order to facilitate their prompt receipt of payment for installment paper purchased by Holding Company B. Corporation Y made collections of delinquent paper or delinquent installments, which sometimes involved repossession and resale of the automobile or other property which secured the paper. Also, upon request of purchasers obligated on paper held by Holding Company B, Corporation Y transmitted installment payments to Holding Company B.

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.104(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> While the term “services” is sometimes used in a broad and general sense, the legislative history of the Bank Holding Company Act indicates that in section 4(c)(1) the word was meant to be somewhat more limited in its application. An early version of the bill specifically exempted companies engaged in serving the bank holding company and its subsidiary banks in “auditing, appraising, investment counseling”. The statute as finally enacted does not expressly mention any specific type of servicing activity for exemption. In recommending the change, the Senate Banking and Currency Committee stated that the types of services contemplated are “in the fields of advertising, public relations, developing new business, organizations, operations, preparing tax returns, personnel, and many others”, which indicates that latitude should be given to the range of activities contemplated by this section beyond those specifically set forth in the early draft of the bill. (84th Cong., 2d Sess., Senate Report 1095, Part 2, p. 3.) It nevertheless seems evident that Congress intended such services to be types of activities generally comparable to those mentioned above from the early bill (“auditing, appraising, investment counseling”) and in the excerpt from the Committee Report on the later bill (“advertising, public relations, developing new business, organization, operations, preparing tax returns, personnel, and many others”). This legislative history and the context in which the term “services” is used in section 4(c)(1) seem to suggest that the term was in general intended to refer to servicing operations which a bank could carry on itself, but which the bank or its holding company chooses to have done through another organization. Moreover, the report of the Senate Banking and Currency Committee indicated that the types of servicing permitted under section 4(c)(1) are to be distinguished from activities of a “financial, fiduciary, or insurance nature”, such as those which might be considered for possible exemption under section 4(c)(6) of the Act. </p>

This latter and basic activity of Corporation X appeared to involve essentially a financial relationship between it and the banking subsidiaries of Holding Company A and appeared beyond the category of servicing exemptions contemplated by section 4(c)(1) of the Act. Accordingly, it was the Board's view that Corporation X could not be regarded as qualifying under section 4 (c)(1) as a company engaged “solely in the business of furnishing services to or performing services for” Holding Company A or subsidiary banks thereof. </p>

There was some question as to whether or not some of the other activities of Corporation Y mentioned above could meet the test, but on balance, it seemed that all such activities probably were activities in which Holding Company B, which as already indicated was a bank, could itself engage, at the present locations of Corporation Y, without being engaged in the operation of bank branches at those locations. In the circumstances, while the question was not free from doubt, the Board expressed the opinion that the activities of Corporation Y were those of a company engaged “solely in the business of furnishing services to or performing services for” Holding Company B within the meaning of section 4(c)(1) of the Act, and that, accordingly, the control by Holding Company B of shares in Corporation Y was exempted under that section. </p></div>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.112(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> However, section 304 of the SBI Act provides that debentures of a small business concern purchased by a small business investment company may be converted at the option of such company into stock of the small business concern. The question therefore arises as to whether, in the event of such conversion, the parent bank holding company would be regarded as having acquired “direct or indirect ownership or control” of stock of the small business concern in violation of section 4(a) of the Holding Company Act. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.112(d)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>d<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Small Business Investment Act clearly contemplates that one of the primary purposes of that Act was to enable SBICs to provide needed equity capital to small business concerns through the purchase of debentures convertible into stock. Thus, to the extent that a stockholder in an SBIC might acquire indirect control of stock of a small business concern, such control appears to be a natural and contemplated incident of ownership of stock of the SBIC. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has informally indicated concurrence with this interpretation insofar as it affects investments by national banks in stock of an SBIC. </p>

The latter kinds of activities fall within the third category of businesses in which a bank holding company is permitted to engage. In the Board's view, the activities enumerated above fall in substantial part within that third category. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.113(e)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>e<span class="paren">)</span></span> Section 4(a)(2), like all other sections of the Holding Company Act, must be interpreted in the light of all of its provisions, as well as in the light of other sections of the Act. The expression “managing * * * banks,” if it could be taken by itself, might appear to include activities of the sort enumerated. However, such an interpretation of those words would virtually nullify the last portion of section 4(a)(2), which permits a holding company to furnish services to or perform services for “any bank of which it owns or controls 25 per centum or more of the voting shares.” </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.113(f)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>f<span class="paren">)</span></span> Since Congress explicitly authorized the performance of services for banks that are at least 25 percent owned by a holding company, it obviously intended that the holding company should not perform services for banks in which it owns less than 25 percent of the voting shares. However, if the second category—“managing or controlling banks”—were interpreted to permit the holding company to perform services for any bank, including a bank in which it held less than 25 percent of the stock (or no stock whatsoever), the last clause of section 4(a)(2) would be meaningless. </p>

To repeat, such active participation in operations falls within the third category (“furnishing services to or performing services for any bank”) and consequently may be engaged in only with respect to banks in which the holding company “owns or controls 25 per centum or more of the voting shares.” </p>

Under the Act such furnishing or performing of services is permissible only if the holding company owns or controls 25 percent of the voting shares of each bank receiving such services, and, since the company owns less than 25 percent of the voting shares of these banks, it follows that these activities are prohibited by section 4(a)(2). </p>

In addition to being charged with the administration of the latter Act, the Board is named in the Bank Service Corporation Act as the Federal supervisory agency with respect to the performance of bank services for State member banks. </p>

This is true because none of the stock of the corporation performing the services is owned by any bank and the corporation, therefore, is not a “bank service corporation” as defined in section 1(c) of the Act. A corporation cannot meet that definition unless part of its stock is owned by two or more banks. The situation clearly is unaffected by section 2(b) of the Act which permits a corporation that fell within the definition initially to continue to function as a bank service corporation although subsequently only one of the banks remains as a stockholder in the corporation. </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.115(b)(3)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>3<span class="paren">)</span></span> However, although it is not a bank service corporation, the corporation in question and each of the banks for which it performs bank services are subject to section 5 of the Bank Service Corporation Act. That section, which requires the furnishing of certain assurances to the appropriate Federal supervisory agency in connection with the performance of bank services for a bank, is applicable whether such services are performed by a bank service corporation or by others. </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.115(b)(4)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>4<span class="paren">)</span></span> Section 4(a)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the acquisition by a bank holding company of “direct or indirect ownership or control” of shares of a nonbanking company, subject to certain exceptions. Section 4(c)(1) of the Act exempts from section 4(a)(1) shares of a company engaged “solely in the business of furnishing services to or performing services for” its bank holding company or subsidiary banks thereof. Assuming that the bank services performed by the corporation in question are “services” of the kinds contemplated by section 4(c)(1) of the Bank Holding Company Act (as would be true, for example, of the electronic data processing of deposit accounts), the holding company's ownership of the corporation's shares in the situation described above clearly is permissible under that section of the Act. </p>

This stock ownership is one of the important facts differentiating this case from the first one. Being a bank service corporation, the corporation in question is subject to section 3 of the Act concerning applications to bank service corporations by competitive banks for bank services, and to section 4 forbidding a bank service corporation from engaging in any activity other than the performance of bank services for banks.

This is permissible because section 2(a) of the Bank Service Corporation Act, which authorizes any two or more banks to invest limited amounts in a bank service corporation, removes all limitations and prohibitions of Federal law exclusively relating to banks that otherwise would prevent any such investment. From the legislative history of section 2(a), it is clear that section 6 of the Bank Holding Company Act is among the limitations and prohibitions so removed. But for such removal, section 6(a)(1) of that Act would make it unlawful for any of the subsidiary banks of the bank holding company in question to own stock in the bank service corporation subsidiary of the holding company, as the exemption in section 6(b)(1) would not apply because of the servicing by the bank service corporation of nonsubsidiary banks. </p>

The bank holding company, however, is entitled to the benefit of the exemption in section 4(c)(4) of the Act. That section exempts from section 4(a) “shares which are of the kinds and amounts eligible for investment by National banking associations under the provisions of section 5136 of the Revised Statutes”. Section 5136 provides, in part, that: “Except as hereinafter provided or otherwise permitted by law, nothing herein contained shall authorize the purchase by the association for its own account of any shares of stock of any corporation.” As the provisions of section 2(a) of the Bank Service Corporation Act and its legislative history make it clear that shares of a bank service corporation are of a kind eligible for investment by national banks under section 5136, it follows that the direct or indirect ownership on control of such shares by a bank holding company are permissible within the amount limitation discussed in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-225.115#p-225.115(d)" class="cfr external">paragraph (d)</a> of this section. </p>

Customers of these banks have requested that the banks provide for them computerized billing, accounting, and financial records maintenance services. The banks wish to utilize the computer services of the service company in providing these and other services of a similar nature. It is proposed that, in each instance where a subsidiary bank undertakes to provide such services, the bank will enter into a contract directly with the customer and then arrange to have the service company perform the services for it, the bank. In no case will the service company provide services for anyone other than its affiliated banks. Moreover, it will not hold itself out as, nor will its parent corporation or affiliated banks represent it to be, authorized or willing to provide services for others. </p>

A determination as to whether a particular service may legitimately be rendered or performed by a bank for its customers must be made in the light of applicable Federal or State statutory or regulatory provisions. In the case of a State-chartered bank, the laws of the State in which the bank operates, together with any interpretations thereunder rendered by appropriate bank authorities, would govern the right of the bank to provide a particular service. In the case of a national bank, a similar determination would require reference to provisions of Federal law relating to the establishment and operation of national banks, as well as to pertinent rulings or interpretations promulgated thereunder. </p>

Thus, so far as Federal Banking law applicable to State member banks is concerned, the answer to the foregoing question depends on the provisions of section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended by the 1966 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act.

The company would also participate in the preparation of applications for mortgage loans, which it would submit, together with recommendations with respect to action thereon, to the bank, which alone would decide whether to make any or all of the loans requested.

The two exceptions principally involved in the question presented are with respect to (1) stock that is eligible for investment by a national bank (section 4(c)(5) of the Act) and (2) shares of a company “furnishing services to or performing services for such bank holding company or its banking subsidiaries” (section 4(c)(1)(C) of the Act). </p>

There is no specific statutory provision authorizing a national bank to purchase stock in a mortgage company, and in the Board's view such purchase may not properly be regarded as authorized under the “incidental powers” clause. (See 1966 Federal Reserve Bulletin 1151; <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-208.119" class="cfr external">12 CFR 208.119</a>.)

The basic purpose of section 4 of the Act is to confine a bank holding company's activities to the management and control of banks. In determining whether an activity in which a bank could itself engage is within the servicing exemption, the question is simply whether such activity may appropriately be considered as “furnishing services to or performing services for” a bank. </p>

The legislative history further indicates that some other activities also are within the scope of the exemption. However, the types of servicing permitted under such exemption must be distinguished from activities of a “financial fiduciary, or insurance nature”, such as those that might be considered for possible exemption under section 4(c)(8) of the Act. </p>

In other words, if the mortgage company is to act merely as an adjunct to a bank for the purpose of facilitating the banks operations, the company may appropriately be considered as within the scope of the servicing exemption.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.122-footnote-1" id="225.122-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  </p>

Underwriting or dealing in shares of stock are nonbanking activities prohibited to bank holding companies by section 4(a)(2) of the Act, unless otherwise exempted. Under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-225.4#p-225.4(g)" class="cfr external">§ 225.4(g)</a> of Regulation Y, foreign bank holding companies are exempt from the prohibitions of section 4 of the Act with respect to their activities outside the United States; thus foreign bank holding companies may underwrite or deal in shares of stock (including shares of United States issuers) to be distributed outside the United States, provided that shares so acquired are disposed of within a reasonable time. </p>

The Board has made one exception to this general approach. A foreign bank holding company will be considered to indirectly own or control voting shares of a bank if that bank holding company acquires more than 5 percent of any class of voting shares of another bank holding company.

Accordingly, the Board regards the Glass-Steagall Act provisions and the Board's prior interpretations thereof as applicable to a holding company's activities as an investment adviser. Consistently with the spirit and purpose of the Glass-Steagall Act, this interpretation applies to all bank holding companies registered under the Bank Holding Company Act irrespective of whether they have subsidiaries that are member banks. </p>

<div id="p-225.125(h)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.125(h)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>h<span class="paren">)</span></span> Under section 20 of the Glass-Steagall Act, a member bank is prohibited from being affiliated with a company that directly, or through a subsidiary, engages principally in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities. A bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiary may not engage, directly or indirectly, in the underwriting, public sale or distribution of securities of any investment company for which the holding company or any nonbank subsidiary provides investment advice except in compliance with the terms of section 20, and only after obtaining the Board's approval under section 4 of the Bank Holding Company Act and subject to the limitations and disclosures required by the Board in those cases. The Board has determined, however, that the conduct of securities brokerage activities by a bank holding company or its nonbank subsidiaries, when conducted individually or in combination with investment advisory activities, is not deemed to be the underwriting, public sale, or distribution of securities prohibited by the Glass-Steagall Act, and the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld that determination. <em>See Securities Industry Ass'n</em> v. <em>Board of Governors,</em> 468 U.S. 207 (1984); <em>see also Securities Industry Ass'n</em> v. <em>Board of Governors,</em> 821 F.2d 810 (D.C. Cir. 1987), <em>cert. denied,</em> 484 U.S. 1005 (1988). Accordingly, the Board believes that a bank holding company or any of its nonbank subsidiaries that has been authorized by the Board under the Bank Holding Company Act to conduct securities brokerage activities (either separately or in combination with investment advisory activities) may act as agent, upon the order and for the account of customers of the holding company or its nonbank subsidiary, to purchase or sell shares of an investment company for which the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries acts as an investment adviser. In addition, a bank holding company or any of its nonbank subsidiaries that has been authorized by the Board under the Bank Holding Company Act to provide investment advice to third parties generally (either separately or in combination with securities brokerage services) may provide investment advice to customers with respect to the purchase or sale of shares of an investment company for which the holding company or any of its subsidiaries acts as an investment adviser. In the event that a bank holding company or any of its nonbank subsidiaries provides brokerage or investment advisory services (either separately or in combination) to customers in the situations described above, at the time the service is provided the bank holding company should instruct its officers and employees to caution customers to read the prospectus of the investment company before investing and must advise customers in writing that the investment company's shares are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and are not deposits, obligations of, or endorsed or guaranteed in any way by, any bank, unless that happens to be the case. The holding company or nonbank subsidiary must also disclose in writing to the customer the role of the company or affiliate as adviser to the investment company. These disclosures may be made orally so long as written disclosure is provided to the customer immediately thereafter. To the extent that a bank owned by a bank holding company engages in providing advisory or brokerage services to bank customers in connection with an investment company advised by the bank holding company or a nonbank affiliate, but is not required by the bank's primary regulator to make disclosures comparable to the disclosures required to be made by bank holding companies providing such services, the bank holding company should require its subsidiary bank to make the disclosures required in this paragraph to be made by a bank holding company that provides such advisory or brokerage services. </p>

Such transportation activities are of particular importance in the check clearing process of the banking system, but are also important to the performance of other activities, including the processing of financially-related economic data. The authority is not intended to permit holding companies to engage generally in the provision of transportation services. </p>
</div>
<p>During the course of the Board's proceedings pertaining to courier services, objections were made that courier activities were not a proper incident to banking because of the possibility that holding companies would or had engaged in unfair competitive practices. The Board believes that adherence to the following principles will eliminate or reduce to an insignificant degree any possibility of unfair competition: </p>
<p>a. A holding company courier subsidiary established under section 4(c)(8) should be a separate, independent corporate entity, not merely a servicing arm of a bank. </p>
<p>b. As such, the subsidiary should exist as a separate, profit-oriented operation and should not be subsidized by the holding company system. </p>
<p>c. Services performed should be explicitly priced, and shall not be paid for indirectly, for example, on the basis of deposits maintained at or loan arrangements with affiliated banks. </p>
<p class="flush-paragraph">Accordingly, entry of holding companies into courier activities on the basis of section 4(c)(8) will be conditioned as follows: </p>
<p>1. <em>The courier subsidiary shall perform services on an explicit fee basis and shall be structured as an individual profit center designed to be operated on a profitable basis.</em> The Board may regard operating losses sustained over an extended period as being inconsistent with continued authority to engage in courier activities. </p>
<p>2. <em>Courier services performed on behalf of an affiliate's customer</em> (<em>such as the carriage of incoming cash letters</em>) <em>shall be paid for by the customer. Such payments shall not be made indirectly, for example, on the basis of imputed earnings on deposits maintained at or of loan arrangements with subsidiaries of the holding company.</em> Concern has also been expressed that bank-affiliated courier services will be utilized to gain a competitive advantage over firms competing with other holding company affiliates. To reduce the possibility that courier affiliates might be so employed, the Board will impose the following third condition: </p>
<p>3. <em>The courier subsidiary shall, when requested by any bank or any data processing firm providing financially-related data processing services which firm competes with a banking or data processing</em> subsidiary of Applicant, furnish comparable service at comparable rates, unless compliance with such request would be beyond the courier subsidiary's practical capacity. In this regard, the courier subsidiary should make known to the public its minimum rate schedule for services and its general pricing policies thereto. The courier subsidiary is also expected to maintain for a reasonable period of time (not less than two years) each request denied with the reasons for such denial. </p>

The facts indicated that the applicant company had incurred debt for the purpose of acquiring bank shares and immediately after the purchase the shares were transferred to an unaffiliated escrow agent with instructions to retain possession of the shares pending Board action on the company's application to become a bank holding company. The escrow agreement provided that, if the application were approved by the Board, the escrow agent was to return the shares to the applicant company; and, if the application were denied, the escrow agent was to deliver the shares to the applicant company's shareholders upon their assumption of debt originally incurred by the applicant in the acquisition of the bank shares. In addition, the escrow agreement provided that, while the shares were held in escrow, the applicant could not exercise voting or any other ownership rights with respect to those shares. </p>

In view of these findings, individuals and bank holding companies should not enter into escrow arrangements of the type described herein, or any similar arrangement, without securing the prior approval of the Board, since such action could constitute a violation of the Act. </p>

However, the investment of each holding company would be represented by a separate class of voting security, so that each stockholder would own 100 percent of its respective class. The participating companies would execute a formal “Agreement Among Stockholders” under which each would agree to use its best efforts at all times to direct or recommend to customers and clients the placement of their life, accident and health insurance directly or indirectly with the company. Such credit-related insurance placed with the company would be identified in the records of the company as having been originated by the respective stockholder. A separate capital account would be maintained for each stockholder consisting of the original capital contribution increased or decreased from time to time by the net profit or loss resulting from the insurance business attributable to each stockholder. Thus, each stockholder would receive a return on its investment based upon the claims experience and profitability of the insurance business that it had itself generated. Dividends declared by the board of directors of the company would be payable to each stockholder only out of the earned surplus reflected in the respective stockholder's capital account. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.137(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> It has been requested that the Board issue an interpretation that section 4(c)(6) of the Act provides an exemption under which participating bank holding companies may acquire such interests in the company without prior approval of the Board. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-225.137(d)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.137(d)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>d<span class="paren">)</span></span> On the basis of a careful review of the documents submitted, in light of the purposes and provisions of the Act, the Board has concluded that section 4(c)(6) of the Act is inapplicable to this proposal and that a bank holding company must obtain the approval of the Board before participating in such a proposal in the manner described. The Board's conclusion is based upon the following considerations: </p>
<div id="p-225.137(d)(1)">
<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.137(d)(1)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>1<span class="paren">)</span></span> Section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Act provides that a company is deemed to have control over a second company if it owns or controls “25 per centum or more of any class of voting securities” of the second company. In the case presented, the stock interest of each participant would be evidenced by a different class of stock and each would accordingly, own 100 percent of a class of voting securities of the company. Thus, each of the stockholders would be deemed to “control” the company and prior Board approval would be required for each stockholder's acquisition of stock in the company. </p>
<p class="flush-paragraph indent-2 no-hierarchy">The Board believes that this application of section 2(a)(2)(A) of the Act is particularly appropriate on the facts presented here. The company is, in practical effect, a conglomeration of separate business ventures each owned 100 percent by a stockholder the value of whose economic interest in the company is determined by reference to the profits and losses attributable to its respective class of stock. Furthermore, it is the Board's opinion that this application of section 2(a)(2)(A) is not inconsistent with section 4(c)(6). Even assuming that section (4)(c)(6) is intended to refer to all outstanding voting shares, and not merely the outstanding shares of a particular class of securities, section 4(c)(6) must be viewed as permitting ownership of 5 percent of a company's voting stock only when that ownership does not constitute “control” as otherwise defined in the Act. For example, it is entirely possible that a company could exercise a controlling influence over the management and policies of a second company, and thus “control” that company under the Act's definitions, even though it held less than 5 percent of the voting stock of the second company. To view section 4(c)(6) as an unqualified exemption for holdings of less than 5 percent would thus create a serious gap in the coverage of the Act. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-225.137(d)(2)">
<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.137(d)(2)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>2<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Board believes that section 4(c)(6) should properly be interpreted as creating an exemption from the general prohibitions in section 4 on ownership of stock in nonbank companies only for passive investments amounting to not more than 5 percent of a company's outstanding stock, and that the exemption was not intended to allow a group of holding companies, through concerted action, to engage in an activity as entrepreneurs. Section 4 of the Act, of course, prohibits not only owning stock in nonbank companies, but engaging in activities other than banking or those activities permitted by the Board under section 4(c)(8) as being closely related to banking. Thus, if a holding company may be deemed to be engaging in an activity through the medium of a company in which it owns less than 5 percent of the voting stock it may nevertheless require Board approval, despite the section 4(c)(6) exemption. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.137(e)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>e<span class="paren">)</span></span> To accept the argument that section 4(c)(6) is an unqualified grant of permission to a bank holding company to own 5 percent of the shares of any nonbanking company irrespective of the nature or extent of the holding company's participation in the affairs of the nonbanking company would, in the Board's view, create the potential for serious and widespread evasion of the Act's controls over nonbanking activities. Such a construction would allow a group of 20 bank holding companies—or even a single bank holding company and one or more nonbank companies—to engage in entrepreneurial joint ventures in businesses prohibited to bank holding companies, a result the Board believes to be contrary to the intent of Congress. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-225.137(f)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.137(f)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>f<span class="paren">)</span></span> In this proposal, each of the participating stockholders must be viewed as engaging in the business of insurance underwriting. Each stockholder would agree to channel to the company the insurance business it generates, and the value of the interest of each stockholder would be determined by reference to the profitability of the business generated by that stockholder itself. There is no sharing or pooling among stockholders of underwriting risks assumed by the company, and profit or loss from investments is allocated on the basis of each bank holding company's allocable underwriting profit or loss. The interest of each stockholder is thus clearly that of an entrepreneur rather than that of an investor. </p>

<div id="p-225.138(a)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.138(a)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>a<span class="paren">)</span></span> From time to time the Board of Governors receives requests from companies subject to the Bank Holding Company Act, or other laws administered by the Board, to extend time periods specified either by statute or by Board order for the divestiture of assets held or activities engaged in by such companies. Such divestiture requirements may arise in a number of ways. For example, divestiture may be ordered by the Board in connection with an acquisition found to have been made in violation of law. In other cases the divestiture may be pursuant to a statutory requirement imposed at the time and amendment to the Act was adopted, or it may be required as a result of a foreclosure upon collateral held by the company or a bank subsidiary in connection with a debt previously contracted in good faith. Certain divestiture periods may be extended in the discretion of the Board, but in other cases the Board may be without statutory authority, or may have only limited authority, to extend a specified divestiture period. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-225.138(b)">
<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.138(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> In the past, divestitures have taken many different forms, and the Board has followed a variety of procedures in enforcing divestiture requirements. Because divestitures may occur under widely disparate factual circumstances, and because such forced dispositions may have the potential for causing a serious adverse economic impact upon the divesting company, the Board believes it is important to maintain a large measure of flexibility in dealing with divestitures. For these reasons, there can be no fixed rule as to the type of divestiture that will be appropriate in all situations. For example, where divestiture has been ordered to terminate a control relationship created or maintained in violation of the Act, it may be necessary to impose conditions that will assure that the unlawful relationship has been fully terminated and that it will not arise in the future. In other circumstances, however, less stringent conditions may be appropriate. </p>

There will generally be substantial advantages to divesting companies in taking steps to plan for and accomplish divestitures well before the end of the divestiture period. For example, delays may impair the ability of the company to realize full value for the divested assets, for as the end of the divestiture period approaches the “forced sale” aspect of the divestiture may lead potential buyers to withhold firm offers and to bargain for lower prices. In addition, because some prospective purchasers may themselves require regulatory approval to acquire the divested property, delay by the divesting company may—by leaving insufficient time to obtain such approvals—have the effect of narrowing the range of prospective purchases. Thus, delay in planning for divestiture may increase the likelihood that the company will seek an extension of the time for divestiture if difficulty is encountered in securing a purchaser, and in certain situations, of course, the Board may be without statutory authority to grant extensions. </p>

Such a requirement may be imposed pursuant to the Board's authority under section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act to issue such orders as may be necessary to enable the Board to administer and carry out the purposes of the Act and prevent evasions thereof. A divestiture plan should be as specific as possible, and should indicate the manner in which divestiture will be accomplished—for example, by a bulk sale of the assets to a third party, by “spinoff” or distribution of shares to the shareholders of the divesting company, or by termination of prohibited activities. In addition, the plan should specify the steps the company expects to take in effecting the divestiture and assuring its completeness, and should indicate the time schedule for taking such steps. In appropriate circumstances, the divestiture plan should make provision for assuring that “controlling influence” relationships, such as management or financial interlocks, will not continue to exist. </p>

Such a requirement may be imposed pursuant to the Board's authority under section 5(b) of the Bank Holding Company Act, referred to above, as well as its authority under section 5(c) of the Act to require reports for the purpose of keeping the Board informed as to whether the Act and Board regulations and order thereunder are being complied with. Reports should set forth in detail such matters as the identities of potential buyers who have been approached by the company, the dates of discussions with potential buyers and the identities of the individuals involved in such discussions, the terms of any offers received, and the reasons for rejecting any offers. In addition, the reports should indicate whether the company has employed brokers, investment bankers or others to assist in the divestiture, or its reasons for not doing so, and should describe other efforts by the company to seek out possible purchasers. The purpose of requiring such reports is to insure that substantial and good faith efforts being made by the company to satisfy its divestiture obligations. The frequency of such reports may vary depending upon the nature of the divestiture and the period specified for divestiture. However, such reports should generally not be required less frequently than every three months, and may in appropriate cases be required on a monthly or even more frequent basis.

In such cases it is imperative that divestiture be accomplished in a timely manner. In certain other cases, the Board may have discretion to extend a statutorily prescribed divestiture period within specified limits. For example, under section 4(c)(2) of the Act the Board may extend for three one-year periods the two-year period in which a bank subsidiary of a holding company is otherwise required to divest shares acquired in satisfaction of a debt previously contracted in good faith. In such cases, however, when the permissible extensions expire the Board no longer has discretion to grant further extensions. In still other cases, where a divestiture period is prescribed by the Board, in the exercise of its regulatory judgment, the Board may have broader discretion to grant extensions. Where extensions of specified divestiture periods are permitted by law, extensions should not be granted except under compelling circumstances. Neither unfavorable market conditions, nor the possibility that the company may incur some loss, should alone be viewed as constituting such circumstances—particularly if the company has failed to take earlier steps to accomplish a divestiture under more favorable circumstances. Normally, a request for an extension will not be considered unless the company has established that it has made substantial and continued good faith efforts to accomplish the divestiture within the prescribed period. Furthermore, requests for extensions of divestiture periods must be made sufficiently in advance of the expiration of the prescribed period both to enable the Board to consider the request in an orderly manner and to enable the company to effect a timely divestiture in the event the request for extension is denied. Companies subject to divestiture requirements should be aware that a failure to accomplish a divestiture within the prescribed period may in and of itself be viewed as a separate violation of the Act. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.139(a)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>a<span class="paren">)</span></span> Section 2(g)(3) of the Bank Holding Company Act (the “Act”) establishes a statutory presumption that where certain specified relationships exist between a transferor and transferee of shares, the transferor (if it is a bank holding company, or a company that would be such but for the transfer) continues to own or control indirectly the transferred shares.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.139-footnote-1" id="225.139-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  This presumption arises by operation of law, as of the date of the transfer, without the need for any order or determination by the Board. Operation of the presumption may be terminated only by the issuance of a Board determination, after opportunity for hearing, “that the transferor is not in fact capable of controlling the transferee.”<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.139-footnote-2" id="225.139-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.139(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> The purpose of section 2(g)(3) is to provide the Board an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of divestitures in certain situations in which there may be a risk that the divestiture will not result in the complete termination of a control relationship. By presuming control to continue as a matter of law, section 2(g)(3) operates to allow the effectiveness of the divestiture to be assessed before the divesting company is permitted to act on the assumption that the divestiture is complete. Thus, for example, if a holding company divests its banking interest under circumstances where the presumption of continued control arises, the divesting company must continue to consider itself bound by the Act until an appropriate order is entered by the Board dispelling the presumption. Section 2(g)(3) does not establish a substantive rule that invalidates transfers to which it applies, and in a great many cases the Board has acted favorably on applications to have the presumption dispelled. It merely provides a procedural opportunity for Board consideration of the effect of such transfers in advance of their being deemed effective. Whether or not the statutory presumption arises, the substantive test for assessing the effectiveness of a divestiture is the same—that is, the Board must be assured that all control relationships between the transferor and the transferred property have been terminated and will not be reestablished.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.139-footnote-3" id="225.139-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="225.139(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> In the course of administering section 2(g)(3) the Board has had several occasions to consider the scope of that section. In addition, questions have been raised by and with the Board's staff as to coverage of the section. Accordingly, the Board believes it would be useful to set forth the following interpretations of section 2(g)(3): </p>
<div id="p-225.139(c)(1)">
<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.139(c)(1)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>1<span class="paren">)</span></span> The terms <em>transferor</em> and <em>transferee,</em> as used in section 2(g)(3), include parents and subsidiaries of each. Thus, for example, where a transferee is indebted to a subsidiary of the transferor, or where a specified interlocking relationship exists between the transferor or transferee and a subsidiary of the other (or between subsidiaries of each), the presumption arises. Similarly, if a parent of the transferee is indebted to a parent of the transferor, the presumption arises. The presumption of continued control also arises where an interlock or debt relationship is retained between the divesting company and the company being divested, since the divested company will be or may be viewed as a <em>subsidiary</em> of the transferee or group of transferees. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-225.139(c)(2)">
<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.139(c)(2)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>2<span class="paren">)</span></span> The terms <em>officers, directors,</em> and <em>trustees,</em> as used in section 2(g)(3), include persons performing functions normally associated with such positions (including general partners in a partnership and limited partners having a right to participate in the management of the affairs of the partnership) as well as persons holding such positions in an advisory or honorary capacity. The presumption arises not only where the transferee or transferred company has an officer, director or trustee <em>in common with</em> the transferor, but where the transferee himself holds such a position with the transferor.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.139-footnote-4" id="225.139-footref-4">4</a>] </sup>  It should be noted that where a transfer takes the form of a pro-rata distribution, or <em>spin-off,</em> of shares to a company's shareholders, officers and directors of the transferor company are likely to receive a portion of such shares. The presumption of continued control would, of course, attach to any shares transferred to officers and directors of the divesting company, whether by <em>spinoff</em> or outright sale. However, the presumption will be of legal significance—and will thus require an application under section 2(g)(3)—only where the total number of shares subject to the presumption exceeds one of the applicable thresholds in the Act. For example, where officers and directors of a one-bank holding company receive in the aggregate 25 percent or more of the stock of a bank subsidiary being divested by the holding company, the holding company would be presumed to continue to control the <em>divested</em> bank. In such a case it would be necessary for the divesting company to demonstrate that it no longer controls either the divested bank or the officer/director transferees. However, if officers and directors were to receive in the aggregate less than 25 percent of the bank's stock (and no other shares were subject to the presumption), section 2(g)(3) would not have the legal effect of presuming continued control of the bank.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.139-footnote-5" id="225.139-footref-5">5</a>] </sup>  In the case of a divestiture of nonbank shares, an application under section 2(g)(3) would be required whenever officers and directors of the divesting company received in the aggregate more than 5 percent of the shares of the company being divested. </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.139(c)(3)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>3<span class="paren">)</span></span> Although section 2(g)(3) refers to transfers of <em>shares</em> it is not, in the Board's view, limited to disposition of corporate stock. General or limited partnership interests, for example, are included within the term <em>shares.</em> Furthermore, the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of a company, or the transfer of such a significant volume of assets that the transfer may in effect constitute the disposition of a separate activity of the company, is deemed by the Board to involve a transfer of <em>shares</em> of that company. </p>

<div id="p-225.139(c)(4)">
<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.139(c)(4)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>4<span class="paren">)</span></span> The term <em>indebtedness</em> giving rise to the presumption of continued control under section 2(g)(3) of the Act is not limited to debt incurred in connection with the transfer; it includes any debt outstanding at the time of transfer from the transferee to the transferor or its subsidiaries. However, the Board believes that not every kind of indebtedness was within the contemplation of the Congress when section 2(g)(3) was adopted. Routine business credit of limited amounts and loans for personal or household purposes are generally not the kinds of indebtedness that, standing alone, support a presumption that the creditor is able to control the debtor. Accordingly, the Board does not regard the presumption of section 2(g)(3) as applicable to the following categories of credit, provided the extensions of credit are not secured by the transferred property and are made in the ordinary course of business of the transferor (or its subsidiary) that is regularly engaged in the business of extending credit: </p>

The amounts and terms of the preceding categories of credit should not differ substantially from similar credit extended in comparable circumstances to others who are not transferees. It should be understood that, while the statutory presumption in situations involving these categories of credit may not apply, the Board is not precluded in any case from examining the facts of a particular transfer and finding that the divestiture of control was ineffective based on the facts of record. </p>

<div id="p-225.139(d)"><p class="indent-1" data-title="225.139(d)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>d<span class="paren">)</span></span> Section 2(g)(3) provides that a Board determination that a transferor is not in fact capable of controlling a transferee shall be made after opportunity for hearing. It has been the Board's routine practice since 1966 to publish notice in the <span class="minor-caps">Federal Register</span> of applications filed under section 2(g)(3) and to offer interested parties an opportunity for a hearing. Virtually without exception no comments have been submitted on such applications by parties other than the applicant and, with the exception of one case in which the request was later withdrawn, no hearings have been requested in such cases. Because the Board believes that the hearing provision in section 2(g)(3) was intended as a protection for applicants who are seeking to have the presumption overcome by a Board order, a hearing would not be of use where an application is to be granted. In light of the experience indicating that the publication of <span class="minor-caps">Federal Register</span> notice of such applications has not served a useful purpose, the Board has decided to alter its procedures in such cases. In the future, <span class="minor-caps">Federal Register</span> notice of section 2(g)(3) applications will be published only in cases in which the Board's General Counsel, acting under delegated authority, has determined not to grant such an application and has referred the matter to the Board for decision.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.139-footnote-6" id="225.139-footref-6">6</a>] </sup>  </p></div>

In the situation presented, a lending subsidiary of a bank holding company made a “dpc” acquisition of assets and transferred them to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the bank holding company for the purpose of effecting an orderly divestiture. The question presented was whether such “dpc” assets could be held indefinitely by a bank holding company subsidiary as incidental to its permissible lending activity. </p>

If a nonbanking subsidiary of a bank holding company were permitted, either directly or through a subsidiary, to hold “dpc” assets of substantial amount over an extended period of time, the holding of such property could result in an unsafe or unsound banking practice or in the holding company engaging in an impermissible activity in connection with the assets, rather than liquidating them. </p>

Within the divestiture period it is expected that the company will make good faith efforts to dispose of “dpc” shares or assets at the earliest practicable date. While no specific authorization is necessary to hold such assets for the five-year period, after two years from the date of acquisition of such assets, the holding company should report annually on its efforts to accomplish divestiture to its Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank will monitor the efforts of the company to effect an orderly divestiture, and may order divestiture before the end of the five-year period if supervisory concerns warrant such action. </p>

In the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980, (Pub. L. 96–221) Congress, recognizing that real estate possesses unusual characteristics, amended the National Banking Act to permit national banks to hold real estate for five years and for an additional five-year period subject to certain conditions. Consistent with the policy underlying the recent Congressional enactment, and as a matter of supervisory policy, a bank holding company may be permitted to hold real estate acquired “dpc” beyond the initial five-year period provided that the value of the real estate on the books of the company has been written down to fair market value, the carrying costs are not significant in relation to the overall financial position of the company, and the company has made good faith efforts to effect divestiture. Companies holding real estate for this extended period are expected to make active efforts to dispose of it, and should keep the Reserve Bank advised on a regular basis concerning their ongoing efforts. Fair market value should be derived from appraisals, comparable sales or some other reasonable method. In any case, “dpc” real estate would not be permitted to be held beyond 10 years from the date of its acquisition. </p>

Moreover, to ensure that assets are not carried at inflated values for extended periods of time, the Board expects, in the case of all such intracompany transfers, that the shares or assets will be transferred at a value no greater than the fair market value at the time of transfer and that the transfer will be made in a normal arms-length transaction. </p>

<p>In orders approving the retention by a bank holding company of a 4(c)(8) subsidiary, the Board has stated that it would permit, without any specific regulatory approval, the formation of a wholly owned subsidiary of an approved 4(c)(8) company to engage in activities that such a company could itself engage in directly through a division or department. (<em>Northwestern Financial Corporation,</em> 65 Federal Reserve Bulletin 566 (1979).) Section 4(a)(2) of the Act provides generally that a bank holding company may engage directly in the business of managing and controlling banks and permissible nonbank activities, and in furnishing services directly to its subsidiaries. Even though section 4 of the Act generally prohibits the acquisition of shares of nonbanking organizations, the Board does not believe that such prohibition should apply to the formation by a holding company of a wholly-owned subsidiary to engage in activities that it could engage in directly. Accordingly, as a general matter, the Board will permit without any regulatory approval a bank holding company to form a wholly-owned subsidiary to perform servicing activities for subsidiaries that the holding company itself could perform directly or through a department or a division under section 4(a)(2) of the Act. The Board believes that permitting this type of subsidiary is not inconsistent with the nonbanking prohibitions of section 4 of the Act, and is consistent with the authority in section 4(c)(1)(C) of the Act, which permits a bank holding company, without regulatory approval, to form a subsidiary to perform services for its <em>banking</em> subsidiaries.

The board of directors, a duly authorized committee thereof or the internal auditors should review periodically (at least monthly) all financial contract positions to insure conformity with such policies and limits.

The Board recognizes that the complexity of legitimate business arrangements precludes rigid rules designed to cover all situations and that decisions regarding the existence or absence of control in any particular case must take into account the effect of the combination of provisions and covenants in the agreement as a whole and the particular facts and circumstances of each case. Nevertheless, the Board believes that the factors outlined in this statement provide a framework for guiding bank holding companies in complying with the requirements of the Act. </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.143(c)(2)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>2<span class="paren">)</span></span> After a careful review of a number of these agreements, the Board believes that investments in nonvoting stock, absent other arrangements, can be consistent with the Act.

Since the Act precludes the investors from protecting their investments through ownership or use of voting shares or other exercise of control, the investors have substituted contractual agreements for rights normally achieved through voting shares. </p>

By their terms, these covenants suggest control by the investing company over the management and policies of the acquiree. </p>

These long-term restrictions on voting shares fall within the presumption in the Board's Regulation Y that attributes control of shares to any company that enters into any agreement placing long-term restrictions on the rights of a holder of voting securities.

Another step to avoid control is the right of the acquiree to “call” the equity investment and options or warrants to assure that covenants that may become inhibiting can be avoided by the acquiree. This right makes such investments or agreements more like a loan in which the borrower has a right to escape covenants and avoid the lender's influence by prepaying the loan. </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.143(d)(4)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>4<span class="paren">)</span></span> In this connection, the Board believes that agreements that involve rights to less than 25 percent of the voting shares, with a requirement for a dispersed public distribution in the event of sale, have a much greater prospect of achieving consistency with the Act than agreements involving a greater percentage. This guideline is drawn by analogy from the provision in the Act that ownership of 25 percent or more of the voting securities of a bank constitutes control of the bank. </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.145(b)(1)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>1<span class="paren">)</span></span> At the outset, the Board notes that the scope and application of the Act's limitations on nonbank banks must be guided by the Congressional findings set out in section 4(f)(3) of the BHC Act. Congress was aware that these nonbank banks had been acquired by companies that engage in a wide range of nonbanking activities, such as retailing and general securities activities that are forbidden to bank holding companies under section 4 of the BHC Act. In section 4(f)(3), Congress found that nonbank banks controlled by grandfathered nonbanking companies may, because of their relationships with affiliates, be involved in conflicts of interest, concentration of resources, or other effects adverse to bank safety and soundness. Congress also found that nonbank banks may be able to compete unfairly against banks controlled by bank holding companies by combining banking services with financial services not permissible for bank holding companies. Section 4(f)(3) states that the purpose of the nonbank bank limitations is to minimize any such potential adverse effects or inequities by restricting the activities of nonbank banks until further Congressional action in the area of bank powers could be undertaken. Similarly, the Senate Report accompanying CEBA states that the restrictions CEBA places on nonbank banks “will help prevent existing nonbank banks from changing their basic character * * * while Congress considers proposals for comprehensive legislation; from drastically eroding the separation of banking and commerce; and from increasing the potential for unfair competition, conflicts of interest, undue concentration of resources, and other adverse effects.” S. Rep. No. 100–19, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1987). <em>See also</em> H. Rep. No. 100–261, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 124 (1987) (the “Conference Report”). </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.145(b)(2)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>2<span class="paren">)</span></span> Thus, Congress explicitly recognized in the statute itself that nonbanking companies controlling grandfathered nonbank banks, which include the many of the nation's largest commercial and financial organizations, were being accorded a significant competitive advantage that could not be matched by bank holding companies because of the general prohibition against nonbanking activities in section 4 of the BHC Act. Congress recognized that this inequality in regulatory approach could inflict serious competitive harm on regulated bank holding companies as the grandfathered entities sought to exploit potential synergies between banking and commercial products and services. <em>See</em> Conference Report at 125–126. The basic and stated purpose of the restrictions on grandfathered nonbank banks is to minimize these potential anticompetitive effects. </p>

<p class="indent-2" data-title="225.145(b)(3)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>3<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Board believes that the specific CEBA limitations should be implemented in light of these Congressional findings and the legislative intent reflected in the plain meaning of the terms used in the statute. In those instances when the language of the statute did not provide clear guidance, legislative materials and the Congressional intent manifested in the overall statutory structure were considered. The Board also notes that prior precedent requires that grandfather exceptions in the BHC Act, such as the nonbank bank limitations and particularly the exceptions thereto, are to be interpreted narrowly in order to ensure the proper implementation of Congressional intent.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.145-footnote-3" id="225.145-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>  </p>

The structure and placement of the CEBA activity restriction within section 4 of the BHC Act and its legislative history do, however, provide direction as to certain transactions that Congress intended to treat as separate activities, thereby providing guidance as to the meaning Congress intended to ascribe to the term generally. First, it is clear that the term <em>activity</em> was not meant to refer to banking as a single activity. To the contrary, the term must be viewed as distinguishing between deposit taking and lending activities and treating demand deposit-taking as a separate activity from general deposit-taking and commercial lending as separate from the general lending category. </p>
</div>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(c)(1)(ii)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>ii<span class="paren">)</span></span> Under the activity limitation, a nonbank bank may engage only in activities in which it was “lawfully engaged” as of March 5, 1987. As of that date, a nonbank bank could not have been engaged in both demand deposit-taking and commercial lending activity without placing it and its parent holding company in violation of the BHC Act. Thus, under the activity limitations, a nonbank bank could not after March 5, 1987, commence the demand deposit-taking or commercial lending activity that it did not conduct as of March 5, 1987. The debates and Senate and Conference Reports on CEBA confirm that Congress intended the activity limitation to prevent a grandfathered nonbank bank from converting itself into a full-service bank by both offering demand deposits and engaging in the business of making commercial loans.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.145-footnote-4" id="225.145-footref-4">4</a>] </sup>  Thus, these types of transactions provide a clear guide as to the type of banking transactions that would constitute activities under CEBA and the degree of specificity intended by Congress in interpreting that term. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(c)(1)(iii)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>iii<span class="paren">)</span></span> It is also clear that the activity limitation was not intended simply to prevent a nonbank bank from both accepting demand deposits and making commercial loans; it has a broader scope and purpose. If Congress had meant the term to refer to just these two activities, it would have used the restriction it used in another section of CEBA dealing with nonbank banks owned by bank holding companies which has this result, <em>i.e.,</em> the nonbank bank could not engage in any activity that would have caused it to become a bank under the prior bank definition in the Act. <em>See</em> <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1843" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1843(g)(1)(A)</a>. Indeed, an earlier version of CEBA under consideration by the Senate Banking Committee contained such a provision for nonbank banks owned by commercial holding companies, which was deleted in favor of the broader activity limitation actually enacted. Committee Print No. 1, (Feb. 17, 1987). In this regard, both the Senate Report and Conference Report refer to demand deposit-taking and commercial lending as examples of activities that could be affected by the activity limitation, not as the sole activities to be limited by the provision.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.145-footnote-5" id="225.145-footref-5">5</a>] </sup>  </p>

The activity limitation is contained in section 4 of the BHC Act, which regulates the investments and activities of bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries. The Board believes it reasonable to conclude that by placing the CEBA activity limitation in section 4 of the BHC Act, Congress meant that Board and judicial decisions regarding the meaning of the term <em>activity</em> in that section be looked to for guidance. This is particularly appropriate given the fact that grandfathered nonbank banks, whether owned by bank holding companies or unregulated holding companies, were treated as nonbank companies and not banks before enactment of CEBA. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(c)(1)(v)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>v<span class="paren">)</span></span> This interpretation of the term activity draws support from comments by Senator Proxmire during the Senate's consideration of the provision that the term was not intended to apply “on a product-by-product, customer-by-customer basis.” 133 Cong. Rec. S4054–5 (daily ed. March 27, 1987). This is the same manner in which the Board has interpreted the term activity in the nonbanking provision of section 4 as referring to generic categories of activities, not to discrete products and services. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(c)(1)(vi)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>vi<span class="paren">)</span></span> Accordingly, consistent with the terms and purposes of the legislation and the Congressional intent to minimize unfair competition and the other adverse effects set out in the CEBA findings, the Board concludes that the term <em>activity</em> as used in section 4(f)(3) means any line of banking or nonbanking business. This definition does not, however, envision a product-by-product approach to the activity limitation. The Board believes it would be helpful to describe the application of the activity limitation in the context of the following major categories of activities: deposit-taking, lending, trust, and other activities engaged in by banks. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(c)(2)(i)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>i<span class="paren">)</span></span> With respect to deposit-taking, the Board believes that the activity limitation in section 4(f)(3) generally refers to three types of activity: demand deposit-taking; non-demand deposit-taking with a third party payment capability; and time and savings deposit-taking without third party payment powers. As previously discussed, it is clear from the terms and intent of CEBA that the activity limitation would prevent, and was designed to prevent, nonbank banks that prior to the enactment of CEBA had refrained from accepting demand deposits in order to avoid coverage as a <em>bank</em> under the BHC Act, from starting to take these deposits after enactment of CEBA and thus becoming full-service banks. Accordingly, CEBA requires that the taking of demand deposits be treated as a separate activity. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(c)(2)(ii)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>ii<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Board also considers nondemand deposits withdrawable by check or other similar means for payment to third parties or others to constitute a separate line of business for purposes of applying the activity limitation. In this regard, the Board has previously recognized that this line of business constitutes a permissible but separate activity under section 4 of the BHC Act. Furthermore, the offering of accounts with transaction capability requires different expertise and systems than non-transaction deposit-taking and represented a distinct new activity that traditionally separated banks from thrift and similar institutions. </p>

In discussing the activity limitation, the report recognized a distinction between demand deposits and accounts with transaction capability and those without transaction capability: </p>
<div class="extract">
<p>With respect to deposits, the Committee recognizes that it is legitimate for an institution currently involved in offering demand deposits or other third party transaction accounts to make use of new technologies that are in the process of replacing the existing check-based, paper payment system. Again, however, the Committee does not believe that technology should be used as a lever for an institution that was only incidentally involved in the payment system to transform itself into a significant offeror of transaction account capability.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.145-footnote-6" id="225.145-footref-6">6</a>] </sup>

This distinction is also reflected in the definition of <em>bank</em> in the BHC Act in effect both prior to and after enactment of CEBA as well as in various of the exceptions from this definition. In addition, commercial lending is a specialized form of lending involving different techniques and analysis from other types of lending. Based upon these factors, the Board would view commercial lending as a separate and distinct activity for purposes of the activity limitation in section 4(f)(3). The Board's decisions under section 4 of the BHC Act have not generally differentiated between types of commercial lending, and thus the Board would view commercial lending as a single activity for purposes of CEBA. Thus, a nonbank bank that made commercial loans as of March 5, 1987, could make any type of commercial loan thereafter. </p>

In this regard, the Board notes that whether a particular transaction is a commercial loan must be determined not from the face of the instrument, but from the application of the definition of commercial loan in the <em>Dimension</em> decision to that transaction. Thus, certain transactions of the type mentioned in the Board's ruling at issue in <em>Dimension</em> and in the Senate and Conference Reports in the CEBA legislation<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.145-footnote-8" id="225.145-footref-8">8</a>] </sup>  would be commercial loans if they meet the test for commercial loans established in <em>Dimension.</em> Under this test, a commercial loan would not include, for example, an open-market investment in a commercial entity that does not involve a borrower-lender relationship or negotiation of credit terms, such as a money market transaction. </p>

Mortgage lending and credit card lending are recognized, discrete lines of banking and business activity, involving techniques and processes that are different from and more specialized than those required for general consumer lending. For example, these activities are, in many cases, conducted by specialized institutions, such as mortgage companies and credit card institutions, or through separate organizational structures within an institution, particularly in the case of mortgage lending. Additionally, the Board's decisions under section 4 of the Act have recognized mortgage banking and credit card lending as separate activities for bank holding companies. The Board's Regulation Y reflects this specialization, noting as examples of permissible lending activity: consumer finance, credit card and mortgage lending. <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-225.25#p-225.25(b)(1)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 225.25(b)(1)</a>. Finally, CEBA itself recognizes the specialized nature of credit card lending by exempting an institution specializing in that activity from the bank definition. For purpose of the activity limitation, a consumer mortgage loan will mean any loan to an individual that is secured by real estate and that is not a commercial loan. A credit card loan would be any loan made to an individual by means of a credit card that is not a commercial loan. </p>

Thus, a grandfathered nonbank bank could not, for example, commence after March 5, 1987, any of the following activities (unless it was engaged in such an activity as of that date): discount securities brokerage, full-service securities brokerage investment advisory services, underwriting or dealing in government securities as permissible for member banks, foreign exchange transaction services, real or personal property leasing, courier services, data processing for third parties, insurance agency activities,<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.145-footnote-9" id="225.145-footref-9">9</a>] </sup>  real estate development, real estate brokerage, real estate syndication, insurance underwriting, management consulting, futures commission merchant, or activities of the general type listed in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-225.25#p-225.25(b)" class="cfr external">§ 225.25(b)</a> of Regulation Y. </p>

Thus, a nonbank bank is not engaged in an activity as of March 5, 1987, if the product or service in question was in a planning state as of that date and had not been offered or delivered to a customer. Consistent with prior Board interpretations of the term activity in the grandfather provisions of section 4, the Board does not believe that a company may be engaged in an activity on the basis of a single isolated transaction that was not part of a program to offer the particular product or to conduct in the activity on an ongoing basis.

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(d)(4)(iii)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>iii<span class="paren">)</span></span> In the area of consumer lending, the Board believes the following provide examples of different consumer loan products: mortgage loans to finance the purchase of the borrower's residence, unsecured consumer loans, consumer installment loans secured by the personal property to be purchased (<em>e.g.</em> automobile, boat or home appliance loans), or second mortgage loans.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#225.145-footnote-12" id="225.145-footref-12">12</a>] </sup>  Under this interpretation, a nonbank bank that offered automobile loans through a nonbank affiliate on the grandfather date could market boat loans, appliance loans or any type of secured consumer installment loan through that affiliate. It could not, however, market unsecured consumer loans, home mortgage loans or other types of consumer loans. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(d)(4)(iv)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>iv<span class="paren">)</span></span> In other areas, the Board believes that the determination as to what constitutes a product or service should be made on a case-by-case basis consistent with the principles that the terms <em>product or service</em> must be interpreted in accordance with their ordinary commercial usage and must be narrower in scope than the definition of activity. Essentially, the concept applied in this analysis is one of permitting the continuation of the specific product marketing activity that was undertaken as of March 5, 1987. Thus, for example, while insurance underwriting may constitute a separate activity under CEBA, a nonbank bank could not market a life insurance policy issued by the affiliate if on the grandfather date it had only marketed homeowners' policies issued by the affiliate. </p>

The Conference Report indicates a legislative intent not to lock into place the specific terms or conditions of a grandfathered product or service. Conference Report at 126. For example, a nonbank bank marketing a three-year, $5,000 certificate of deposit through an affiliate under the exemption could offer a one-year $2,000 certificate of deposit with a different interest rate after the grandfather date. <em>See</em> footnote 11 above. Modifications that alter the type of product, however, are not permitted. Thus, a nonbank bank that marketed through affiliates on March 5, 1987, only certificates of deposit could not commence marketing MMDA's or NOW accounts after the grandfather date. </p>

An institution must have offered or actually marketed the product or service on March 5 or shortly before that date (as discussed above) to qualify for the grandfather privilege. Thus, if the cross-marketing program was in the planning stage on March 5, 1987, the program would not quality for grandfather treatment under CEBA. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(d)(7)(i)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>i<span class="paren">)</span></span> The cross-marketing restriction in section 4(f)(3) contains a grandfather provision that permits products or services that would otherwise be prohibited from being offered or marketed under the provision to continue to be offered or marketed by a particular entity if the products or services were being so offered or marketed as of March 5, 1987, but “only in the same manner in which they were being offered or marketed as of that date.” Thus, to qualify for the grandfather provision, the manner of offering or marketing the otherwise prohibited product or service must remain the same as on the grandfather date. </p>

<p class="indent-3" data-title="225.145(d)(7)(ii)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>ii<span class="paren">)</span></span> In interpreting this provision, the Board notes that Congress designed the joint-marketing restrictions to prevent the significant risk to the public posed by the conduct of such activities by insured banks affiliated with companies engaged in general commerce, to ensure objectivity in the credit-granting process and to “minimize the unfair competitive advantage that grandfathered commercial companies owning nonbank banks might otherwise engage over regulated bank holding companies and our competing commercial companies that have no subsidiary bank.” Conference Report at 125–126. The Board believes that determinations regarding the manner of cross-marketing of a particular product or service may best be accomplished by applying the limitation to the particular facts in each case consistent with the stated purpose of this provision of CEBA and the general principle that grandfather restrictions and exceptions to general prohibitions must be narrowly construed in order to prevent the exception from nullifying the rule. Essentially, as in the scope of the term “product or service”, the guiding principle of Congressional intent with respect to this term is to permit only the continuation of the specific types of cross-marketing activity that were undertaken as of March 5, 1987. </p>

Conference Report at 126. Thus, an affiliate that was not engaged in cross-marketing products or services as of the grandfather date may not commence these activities under the exemption even if such activities were being conducted by another affiliate. <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also</em> S.

To qualify for grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3), the institution must have “bec[o]me a bank as a result of the enactment of [CEBA]” and must have been controlled by a nonbanking company on March 5, 1987. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1843" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1843(f)(1)(A)</a>. An institution that did not have FDIC insurance on August 10, 1987, and that did not accept demand deposits or transaction accounts or engage in the business of commercial lending on that date, would not have become a <em>bank</em> as a result of enactment of CEBA. Thus, institutions that had not commenced operations on August 10, 1987, could not qualify for grandfather privileges under section 4(f)(3) of CEBA. This view is supported by the activity limitations of section 4(f)(3), which, as noted, limit the activities of grandfathered nonbank banks to those in which they were lawfully engaged as of March 5, 1987. A nonbank bank that had not commenced conducting business activities on March 5, 1987, could not after enactment of CEBA engage in any activities under this provision. </p></div>

Pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, these so-called section 20 subsidiaries are required to register with the SEC as broker-dealers and are subject to all the financial reporting, anti-fraud and financial responsibility rules applicable to broker-dealers. In addition, transactions between insured depository institutions and their section 20 affiliates are restricted by sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/371c" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 371c</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/371c-1" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">371c–1</a>). The Board expects a section 20 subsidiary, like any other subsidiary of a bank holding company, to be operated prudently. Doing so would include observing corporate formalities (such as the maintenance of separate accounting and corporate records), and instituting appropriate risk management, including independent trading and exposure limits consistent with parent company guidelines. </p>

</h4>
<p class="hd1-paragraph">I. Overview
</p>
<p>The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System has adopted a risk-based capital measure to assist in the assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies (<em>banking organizations</em>).<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-1" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>
 The principal objectives of this measure are to: (i) Make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations; (ii) factor off-balance sheet exposures into the assessment of capital adequacy; (iii) minimize disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets; and (iv) achieve greater consistency in the evaluation of the capital adequacy of major banking organizations throughout the world.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-2" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>

</p>


<p>The risk-based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating weighted risk assets by assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. An institution's risk-based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital (the numerator of the ratio) by its weighted risk assets (the denominator).<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-3" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>
 The definition of qualifying capital is outlined below in section II, and the procedures for calculating weighted risk assets are discussed in section III. Attachment I illustrates a sample calculation of weighted risk assets and the risk-based capital ratio.
</p>

<p>In addition, when certain organizations that engage in trading activities calculate their risk-based capital ratio under this appendix A, they must also refer to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-225/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20225" class="cfr external">appendix E of this part</a>, which incorporates capital charges for certain market risks into the risk-based capital ratio. When calculating their risk-based capital ratio under this appendix A, such organizations are required to refer to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-225/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20225" class="cfr external">appendix E of this part</a> for supplemental rules to determine qualifying and excess capital, calculate risk-weighted assets, calculate market risk equivalent assets, and calculate risk-based capital ratios adjusted for market risk.
</p>
<p>The risk-based capital guidelines also establish a schedule for achieving a minimum supervisory standard for the ratio of qualifying capital to weighted risk assets and provide for transitional arrangements during a phase-in period to facilitate adoption and implementation of the measure at the end of 1992. These interim standards and transitional arrangements are set forth in section IV.
</p>
<p>The risk-based guidelines apply on a consolidated basis to any bank holding company with consolidated assets of $500 million or more. The risk-based guidelines also apply on a consolidated basis to any bank holding company with consolidated assets of less than $500 million if the holding company (i) is engaged in significant nonbanking activities either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; (ii) conducts significant off-balance sheet activities (including securitization and asset management or administration) either directly or through a nonbank subsidiary; or (iii) has a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Federal Reserve may apply the risk-based guidelines at its discretion to any bank holding company, regardless of asset size, if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-4" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-4">4</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>The risk-based guidelines are to be used in the inspection and supervisory process as well as in the analysis of applications acted upon by the Federal Reserve. Thus, in considering an application filed by a bank holding company, the Federal Reserve will take into account the organization's risk-based capital ratio, the reasonableness of its capital plans, and the degree of progress it has demonstrated toward meeting the interim and final risk-based capital standards.
</p>
<p>The risk-based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk, although the framework for assigning assets and off-balance sheet items to risk categories does incorporate elements of transfer risk, as well as limited instances of interest rate and market risk. The risk-based ratio does not, however, incorporate other factors that can affect an organization's financial condition. These factors include overall interest rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; the quality and level of earnings; investment or loan portfolio concentrations; the quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; and management's ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks.
</p>
<p>In addition to evaluating capital ratios, an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account of these other factors, including, in particular, the level and severity of problem and classified assets. For this reason, the final supervisory judgment on an organization's capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions that might be drawn solely from the level of the organization's risk-based capital ratio.
</p>
<p>The risk-based capital guidelines establish <em>minimum</em> ratios of capital to weighted risk assets. In light of the considerations just discussed, banking organizations generally are expected to operate well above the minimum risk-based ratios. In particular, banking organizations contemplating significant expansion proposals are expected to maintain strong capital levels substantially above the minimum ratios and should not allow significant diminution of financial strength below these strong levels to fund their expansion plans. Institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk are also expected to operate above minimum capital standards. In all cases, institutions should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed. Banking organizations that do not meet the minimum risk-based standard, or that are otherwise considered to be inadequately capitalized, are expected to develop and implement plans acceptable to the Federal Reserve for achieving adequate levels of capital within a reasonable period of time.
</p>
<p>The Board will monitor the implementation and effect of these guidelines in relation to domestic and international developments in the banking industry. When necessary and appropriate, the Board will consider the need to modify the guidelines in light of any significant changes in the economy, financial markets, banking practices, or other relevant factors.
</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve may determine that the regulatory capital treatment for a banking organization's exposure or other relationship to an entity not consolidated on the banking organization's balance sheet is not commensurate with the actual risk relationship of the banking organization to the entity. In making this determination, the Federal Reserve may require the banking organization to treat the entity as if it were consolidated onto the balance sheet of the banking organization for risk-based capital purposes and calculate the appropriate risk-based capital ratios accordingly, all as specified by the Federal Reserve.
</p>
<p class="hd1-paragraph">II. Definition of Qualifying Capital for the Risk Based Capital Ratio
</p>
<p>(i) A banking organization's qualifying total capital consists of two types of capital components: “core capital elements” (tier 1 capital elements) and “supplementary capital elements” (tier 2 capital elements). These capital elements and the various limits, restrictions, and deductions to which they are subject, are discussed below. To qualify as an element of tier 1 or tier 2 capital, an instrument must be fully paid up and effectively unsecured. Accordingly, if a banking organization has purchased, or has directly or indirectly funded the purchase of, its own capital instrument, that instrument generally is disqualified from inclusion in regulatory capital. A qualifying tier 1 or tier 2 capital instrument must be subordinated to all senior indebtedness of the organization. If issued by a bank, it also must be subordinated to claims of depositors. In addition, the instrument must not contain or be covered by any covenants, terms, or restrictions that are inconsistent with safe and sound banking practices.
</p>
<p>(ii) On a case-by-case basis, the Federal Reserve may determine whether, and to what extent, any instrument that does not fit wholly within the terms of a capital element set forth below, or that does not have the characteristics or the ability to absorb losses commensurate with the capital treatment specified below, will qualify as an element of tier 1 or tier 2 capital. In making such a determination, the Federal Reserve will consider the similarity of the instrument to instruments explicitly addressed in the guidelines; the ability of the instrument to absorb losses, particularly while the organization operates as a going concern; the maturity and redemption features of the instrument; and other relevant terms and factors.
</p>
<p>(iii) The redemption of capital instruments before stated maturity could have a significant impact on an organization's overall capital structure. Consequently, an organization should consult with the Federal Reserve before redeeming any equity or other capital instrument included in tier 1 or tier 2 capital prior to stated maturity if such redemption could have a material effect on the level or composition of the organization's capital base. Such consultation generally would not be necessary when the instrument is to be redeemed with the proceeds of, or replaced by, a like amount of a capital instrument that is of equal or higher quality with regard to terms and maturity and the Federal Reserve considers the organization's capital position to be fully sufficient.
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">A. The Definition and Components of Qualifying Capital
</p>
<p>1. <em>Tier 1 capital.</em> Tier 1 capital generally is defined as the sum of core capital elements less any amounts of goodwill, other intangible assets, interest-only strips receivables, deferred tax assets, nonfinancial equity investments, and other items that are required to be deducted in accordance with section II.B. of this appendix. Tier 1 capital must represent at least 50 percent of qualifying total capital.
</p>
<p>a. <em>Core capital elements (tier 1 capital elements).</em> The elements qualifying for inclusion in the tier 1 component of a banking organization's qualifying total capital are:
</p>
<p>i. Qualifying common stockholders' equity;
</p>
<p>ii. Qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, including related surplus, and senior perpetual preferred stock issued to the United States Department of the Treasury (Treasury) under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA), Division A of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/110/public/343" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 110–343</a> (which for purposes of this appendix shall be considered qualifying noncumulative perpetual preferred stock), including related surplus;
</p>
<p>iii. Minority interest related to qualifying common or noncumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated U.S. depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary (Class A minority interest); and
</p>
<p>iv. Restricted core capital elements. The aggregate of these items is limited within tier 1 capital as set forth in section II.A.1.b. of this appendix. These elements are defined to include:
</p>
<p>(1) Qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus);
</p>
<p>(2) Minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated U.S. depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary (Class B minority interest);
</p>
<p>(3) Minority interest related to qualifying common stockholders' equity or perpetual preferred stock issued by a consolidated subsidiary that is neither a U.S. depository institution nor a foreign bank (Class C minority interest);
</p>
<p>(4) Qualifying trust preferred securities; and
</p>
<p>(5) Subordinated debentures issued prior to October 4, 2010, to the Treasury under the TARP (TARP Subordinated Securities) established by the EESA by a bank holding company that has made a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (S-Corp BHC) or by a bank holding company organized in mutual form (Mutual BHC).
</p>
<p>b. <em>Limits on restricted core capital elements</em>—i. <em>Limits.</em> (1) The aggregate amount of restricted core capital elements that may be included in the tier 1 capital of a banking organization must not exceed 25 percent of the sum of all core capital elements, including restricted core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. Stated differently, the aggregate amount of restricted core capital elements is limited to one-third of the sum of core capital elements, excluding restricted core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the full amount of TARP Subordinated Securities issued by an S–Corp BHC or Mutual BHC may be included in its tier 1 capital, provided that the banking organization must include the TARP Subordinated Securities in restricted core capital elements for the purposes of determining the aggregate amount of other restricted core capital elements that may be included in tier 1 capital in accordance with this section.
</p>
<p>(2) In addition, the aggregate amount of restricted core capital elements (other than qualifying mandatory convertible preferred securities<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-5" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-5">5</a>] </sup>)
 that may be included in the tier 1 capital of an internationally active banking organization<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-6" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-6">6</a>] </sup>
 must not exceed 15 percent of the sum of all core capital elements, including restricted core capital elements, net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability.
</p>


<p>(3) Amounts of restricted core capital elements in excess of this limit generally may be included in tier 2 capital. The excess amounts of restricted core capital elements that are in the form of Class C minority interest and qualifying trust preferred securities are subject to further limitation within tier 2 capital in accordance with section II.A.2.d.iv. of this appendix. A banking organization may attribute excess amounts of restricted core capital elements first to any qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock or to Class B minority interest, and second to qualifying trust preferred securities or to Class C minority interest, which are subject to a tier 2 sublimit.
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Transition.</em>
</p>
<p>(1) The quantitative limits for restricted core capital elements set forth in sections II.A.1.b.i. and II.A.2.d.iv. of this appendix become effective on March 31, 2011. Prior to that time, a banking organization with restricted core capital elements in amounts that cause it to exceed these limits must consult with the Federal Reserve on a plan for ensuring that the banking organization is not unduly relying on these elements in its capital base and, where appropriate, for reducing such reliance to ensure that the organization complies with these limits as of March 31, 2011.
</p>
<p>(2) Until March 31, 2011, the aggregate amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus) and qualifying trust preferred securities that a banking organization may include in tier 1 capital is limited to 25 percent of the sum of the following core capital elements: qualifying common stockholders' equity, Qualifying noncumulative and cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus), qualifying minority interest in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries, and qualifying trust preferred securities. Amounts of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus) and qualifying trust preferred securities in excess of this limit may be included in tier 2 capital.
</p>
<p>(3) Until March 31, 2011, internationally active banking organizations generally are expected to limit the amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock (including related surplus) and qualifying trust preferred securities included in tier 1 capital to 15 percent of the sum of core capital elements set forth in section II.A.1.b.ii.2. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>c. <em>Definitions and requirements for core capital elements</em>—i. <em>Qualifying common stockholders' equity.</em>
</p>
<p>(1) <em>Definition.</em> Qualifying common stockholders' equity is limited to common stock; related surplus; and retained earnings, including capital reserves and adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation, net of any treasury stock, less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values. For this purpose, net unrealized holding gains on such equity securities and net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale debt securities are not included in qualifying common stockholders' equity.
</p>
<p>(2) <em>Restrictions on terms and features.</em> A capital instrument that has a stated maturity date or that has a preference with regard to liquidation or the payment of dividends is not deemed to be a component of qualifying common stockholders' equity, regardless of whether or not it is called common equity. Terms or features that grant other preferences also may call into question whether the capital instrument would be deemed to be qualifying common stockholders' equity. Features that require, or provide significant incentives for, the issuer to redeem the instrument for cash or cash equivalents will render the instrument ineligible as a component of qualifying common stockholders' equity.
</p>
<p>(3) <em>Reliance on voting common stockholders' equity.</em> Although section II.A.1. of this appendix allows for the inclusion of elements other than common stockholders' equity within tier 1 capital, voting common stockholders' equity, which is the most desirable capital element from a supervisory standpoint, generally should be the dominant element within tier 1 capital. Thus, banking organizations should avoid over-reliance on preferred stock and nonvoting elements within tier 1 capital. Such nonvoting elements can include portions of common stockholders' equity where, for example, a banking organization has a class of nonvoting common equity, or a class of voting common equity that has substantially fewer voting rights per share than another class of voting common equity. Where a banking organization relies excessively on nonvoting elements within tier 1 capital, the Federal Reserve generally will require the banking organization to allocate a portion of the nonvoting elements to tier 2 capital.
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Qualifying perpetual preferred stock.</em>
</p>
<p>(1) <em>Qualifying requirements.</em> Perpetual preferred stock qualifying for inclusion in tier 1 capital has no maturity date and cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder. Perpetual preferred stock will qualify for inclusion in tier 1 capital only if it can absorb losses while the issuer operates as a going concern.
</p>
<p>(2) <em>Restrictions on terms and features.</em> Perpetual preferred stock included in tier 1 capital may not have any provisions restricting the banking organization's ability or legal right to defer or waive dividends, other than provisions requiring prior or concurrent deferral or waiver of payments on more junior instruments, which the Federal Reserve generally expects in such instruments consistent with the notion that the most junior capital elements should absorb losses first. Dividend deferrals or waivers for preferred stock, which the Federal Reserve expects will occur either voluntarily or at its direction when an organization is in a weakened condition, must not be subject to arrangements that would diminish the ability of the deferral to shore up the banking organization's resources. Any perpetual preferred stock with a feature permitting redemption at the option of the issuer may qualify as tier 1 capital only if the redemption is subject to prior approval of the Federal Reserve. Features that require, or create significant incentives for the issuer to redeem the instrument for cash or cash equivalents will render the instrument ineligible for inclusion in tier 1 capital. For example, perpetual preferred stock that has a credit-sensitive dividend feature—that is, a dividend rate that is reset periodically based, in whole or in part, on the banking organization's current credit standing—generally does not qualify for inclusion in tier 1 capital.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-7" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-7">7</a>] </sup>
 Similarly, perpetual preferred stock that has a dividend rate step-up or a market value conversion feature—that is, a feature whereby the holder must or can convert the preferred stock into common stock at the market price prevailing at the time of conversion—generally does not qualify for inclusion in tier 1 capital.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-8" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-8">8</a>] </sup>

</p>


<p>(3) <em>Noncumulative and cumulative features.</em> Perpetual preferred stock that is noncumulative generally may not permit the accumulation or payment of unpaid dividends in any form, including in the form of common stock. Perpetual preferred stock that provides for the accumulation or future payment of unpaid dividends is deemed to be cumulative, regardless of whether or not it is called noncumulative.
</p>
<p>iii. <em>Qualifying minority interest.</em> Minority interest in the common and preferred stockholders' equity accounts of a consolidated subsidiary (minority interest) represents stockholders' equity associated with common or preferred equity instruments issued by a banking organization's consolidated subsidiary that are held by investors other than the banking organization. Minority interest is included in tier 1 capital because, as a general rule, it represents equity that is freely available to absorb losses in the issuing subsidiary. Nonetheless, minority interest typically is not available to absorb losses in the banking organization as a whole, a feature that is a particular concern when the minority interest is issued by a subsidiary that is neither a U.S. depository institution nor a foreign bank. For this reason, this appendix distinguishes among three types of qualifying minority interest. Class A minority interest is minority interest related to qualifying common and noncumulative perpetual preferred equity instruments issued directly (that is, not through a subsidiary) by a consolidated U.S. depository institution<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-9" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-9">9</a>] </sup>
 or foreign bank<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-10" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-10">10</a>] </sup>
 subsidiary of a banking organization. Class A minority interest is not subject to a formal limitation within tier 1 capital. Class B minority interest is minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred equity instruments issued directly by a consolidated U.S. depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary of a banking organization. Class B minority interest is a restricted core capital element subject to the limitations set forth in section II.A.1.b.i. of this appendix, but is not subject to a tier 2 sub-limit. Class C minority interest is minority interest related to qualifying common or perpetual preferred stock issued by a banking organization's consolidated subsidiary that is neither a U.S. depository institution nor a foreign bank. Class C minority interest is eligible for inclusion in tier 1 capital as a restricted core capital element and is subject to the limitations set forth in sections II.A.1.b.i. and II.A.2.d.iv. of this appendix. Minority interest in small business investment companies, investment funds that hold nonfinancial equity investments (as defined in section II.B.5.b. of this appendix), and subsidiaries engaged in nonfinancial activities are not included in the banking organization's tier 1 or total capital if the banking organization's interest in the company or fund is held under one of the legal authorities listed in section II.B.5.b. of this appendix.
</p>


<p>iv. <em>Qualifying trust preferred securities.</em>
</p>
<p>(1) A banking organization that wishes to issue trust preferred securities and include them in tier 1 capital must first consult with the Federal Reserve. Trust preferred securities are defined as undated preferred securities issued by a trust or similar entity sponsored (but generally not consolidated) by a banking organization that is the sole common equity holder of the trust. Qualifying trust preferred securities must allow for dividends to be deferred for at least twenty consecutive quarters without an event of default, unless an event of default leading to acceleration permitted under section II.A.1.c.iv.(2) has occurred. The required notification period for such deferral must be reasonably short, no more than 15 business days prior to the payment date. Qualifying trust preferred securities are otherwise subject to the same restrictions on terms and features as qualifying perpetual preferred stock under section II.A.1.c.ii.(2) of this appendix.
</p>
<p>(2) The sole asset of the trust must be a junior subordinated note issued by the sponsoring banking organization that has a minimum maturity of thirty years, is subordinated with regard to both liquidation and priority of periodic payments to all senior and subordinated debt of the sponsoring banking organization (other than other junior subordinated notes underlying trust preferred securities). Otherwise the terms of a junior subordinated note must mirror those of the preferred securities issued by the trust.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-11" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-11">11</a>] </sup>
 The note must comply with section II.A.2.d. of this appendix and the Federal Reserve's subordinated debt policy statement set forth in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-250.166" class="cfr external">12 CFR 250.166</a><sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-12" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-12">12</a>] </sup>
 except that the note may provide for an event of default and the acceleration of principal and accrued interest upon (a) nonpayment of interest for 20 or more consecutive quarters or (b) termination of the trust without redemption of the trust preferred securities, distribution of the notes to investors, or assumption of the obligation by a successor to the banking organization.
</p>


<p>(3) In the last five years before the maturity of the note, the outstanding amount of the associated trust preferred securities is excluded from tier 1 capital and included in tier 2 capital, where the trust preferred securities are subject to the amortization provisions and quantitative restrictions set forth in sections II.A.2.d.iii. and iv. of this appendix as if the trust preferred securities were limited-life preferred stock.
</p>
<p>2. <em>Supplementary capital elements (tier 2 capital elements).</em> The tier 2 component of an institution's qualifying capital may consist of the following items that are defined as supplementary capital elements:
</p>
<p>(i) Allowance for loan and lease losses (subject to limitations discussed below);
</p>
<p>(ii) Perpetual preferred stock and related surplus (subject to conditions discussed below);
</p>
<p>(iii) Hybrid capital instruments (as defined below), perpetual debt, and mandatory convertible debt securities;
</p>
<p>(iv) Term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, including related surplus (subject to limitations discussed below);
</p>
<p>(v) Unrealized holding gains on equity securities (subject to limitations discussed in section II.A.2.e. of this appendix).
</p>
<p>The maximum amount of tier 2 capital that may be included in an institution's qualifying total capital is limited to 100 percent of tier 1 capital (net of goodwill, other intangible assets, interest-only strips receivables and nonfinancial equity investments that are required to be deducted in accordance with section II.<em>B.</em> of this appendix A).
</p>
<p>The elements of supplementary capital are discussed in greater detail below.
</p>
<p>a. <em>Allowance for loan and lease losses.</em> Allowances for loan and lease losses are reserves that have been established through a charge against earnings to absorb future losses on loans or lease financing receivables. Allowances for loan and lease losses exclude “allocated transfer risk reserves,”<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-13" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-13">13</a>] </sup>
 and reserves created against identified losses.
</p>

<p>During the transition period, the risk-based capital guidelines provide for reducing the amount of this allowance that may be included in an institution's total capital. Initially, it is unlimited. However, by year-end 1990, the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that will qualify as capital will be limited to 1.5 percent of an institution's weighted risk assets. By the end of the transition period, the amount of the allowance qualifying for inclusion in Tier 2 capital may not exceed 1.25 percent of weighted risk assets.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-14" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-14">14</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>b. <em>Perpetual preferred stock.</em> Perpetual preferred stock (and related surplus) that meets the requirements set forth in section II.A.1.c.ii.(1) of this appendix is eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital without limit.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-15" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-15">15</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>c. <em>Hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, and mandatory convertible debt securities.</em> Hybrid capital instruments include instruments that are essentially permanent in nature and that have certain characteristics of both equity and debt. Such instruments may be included in Tier 2 without limit. The general criteria hybrid capital instruments must meet in order to qualify for inclusion in Tier 2 capital are listed below:
</p>
<p>(1) The instrument must be unsecured; fully paid-up and subordinated to general creditors. If issued by a bank, it must also be subordinated to claims or depositors.
</p>
<p>(2) The instrument must not be redeemable at the option of the holder prior to maturity, except with the prior approval of the Federal Reserve. (Consistent with the Board's criteria for perpetual debt and mandatory convertible securities, this requirement implies that holders of such instruments may not accelerate the payment of principal except in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency, or reorganization.)
</p>
<p>(3) The instrument must be available to participate in losses while the issuer is operating as a going concern. (Term subordinated debt would not meet this requirement.) To satisfy this requirement, the instrument must convert to common or perpetual preferred stock in the event that the accumulated losses exceed the sum of the retained earnings and capital surplus accounts of the issuer.
</p>
<p>(4) The instrument must provide the option for the issuer to defer interest payments if: a) the issuer does not report a profit in the preceding annual period (defined as combined profits for the most recent four quarters), <em>and</em> b) the issuer eliminates cash dividends on common and preferred stock.
</p>
<p>Perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities that meet the criteria set forth in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-225/appendix-Appendix%20B%20to%20Part%20225" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 225, appendix B</a>, also qualify as unlimited elements of Tier 2 capital for bank holding companies.
</p>
<p>d. <em>Subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock</em>—i. <em>Five-year minimum maturity.</em> Subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock must have an original weighted average maturity of at least five years to qualify as tier 2 capital. If the holder has the option to require the issuer to redeem, repay, or repurchase the instrument prior to the original stated maturity, maturity would be defined, for risk-based capital purposes, as the earliest possible date on which the holder can put the instrument back to the issuing banking organization.
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Other restrictions on subordinated debt.</em> Subordinated debt included in tier 2 capital must comply with the Federal Reserve's subordinated debt policy statement set forth in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-250.166" class="cfr external">12 CFR 250.166</a>.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-16" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-16">16</a>] </sup>
 Accordingly, such subordinated debt must meet the following requirements:
</p>

<p>(1) The subordinated debt must be unsecured.
</p>
<p>(2) The subordinated debt must clearly state on its face that it is not a deposit and is not insured by a Federal agency.
</p>
<p>(3) The subordinated debt must not have credit-sensitive features or other provisions that are inconsistent with safe and sound banking practice.
</p>
<p>(4) Subordinated debt issued by a subsidiary U.S. depository institution or foreign bank of a bank holding company must be subordinated in right of payment to the claims of all the institution's general creditors and depositors, and generally must not contain provisions permitting debt holders to accelerate payment of principal or interest upon the occurrence of any event other than receivership of the institution. Subordinated debt issued by a bank holding company or its subsidiaries that are neither U.S. depository institutions nor foreign banks must be subordinated to all senior indebtedness of the issuer; that is, the debt must be subordinated at a minimum to all borrowed money, similar obligations arising from off-balance sheet guarantees and direct credit substitutes, and obligations associated with derivative products such as interest rate and foreign exchange contracts, commodity contracts, and similar arrangements. Subordinated debt issued by a bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries that is not a U.S. depository institution or foreign bank must not contain provisions permitting debt holders to accelerate the payment of principal or interest upon the occurrence of any event other than the bankruptcy of the bank holding company or the receivership of a major subsidiary depository institution. Thus, a provision permitting acceleration in the event that any other affiliate of the bank holding company issuer enters into bankruptcy or receivership makes the instrument ineligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital.
</p>
<p>iii. <em>Discounting in last five years.</em> As a limited-life capital instrument approaches maturity, it begins to take on characteristics of a short-term obligation. For this reason, the outstanding amount of term subordinated debt and limited-life preferred stock eligible for inclusion in tier 2 capital is reduced, or discounted, as these instruments approach maturity: one-fifth of the outstanding amount is excluded each year during the instrument's last five years before maturity. When remaining maturity is less than one year, the instrument is excluded from tier 2 capital.
</p>
<p>iv. <em>Limits.</em> The aggregate amount of term subordinated debt (excluding mandatory convertible debt) and limited-life preferred stock as well as, beginning March 31, 2011, qualifying trust preferred securities and Class C minority interest in excess of the limits set forth in section II.A.1.b.i. of this appendix that may be included in tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of tier 1 capital (net of goodwill and other intangible assets required to be deducted in accordance with section II.B.1.b. of this appendix). Amounts of these instruments in excess of this limit, although not included in tier 2 capital, will be taken into account by the Federal Reserve in its overall assessment of a banking organization's funding and financial condition.
</p>
<p>e. <em>Unrealized gains on equity securities and unrealized gains (losses) on other assets.</em> Up to 45 percent of pretax net unrealized holding gains (that is, the excess, if any, of the fair value over historical cost) on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values may be included in supplementary capital. However, the Federal Reserve may exclude all or a portion of these unrealized gains from Tier 2 capital if the Federal Reserve determines that the equity securities are not prudently valued. Unrealized gains (losses) on other types of assets, such as bank premises and available-for-sale debt securities, are not included in supplementary capital, but the Federal Reserve may take these unrealized gains (losses) into account as additional factors when assessing an institution's overall capital adequacy.
</p>
<p>f. <em>Revaluation reserves.</em> i. Such reserves reflect the formal balance sheet restatement or revaluation for capital purposes of asset carrying values to reflect current market values. The Federal Reserve generally has not included unrealized asset appreciation in capital ratio calculations, although it has long taken such values into account as a separate factor in assessing the overall financial strength of a banking organization.
</p>
<p>ii. Consistent with long-standing supervisory practice, the excess of market values over book values for assets held by bank holding companies will generally not be recognized in supplementary capital or in the calculation of the risk-based capital ratio. However, all bank holding companies are encouraged to disclose their equivalent of premises (building) and security revaluation reserves. The Federal Reserve will consider any appreciation, as well as any depreciation, in specific asset values as additional considerations in assessing overall capital strength and financial condition.
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">B. Deductions from Capital and Other Adjustments
</p>
<p>Certain assets are deducted from an organization's capital for the purpose of calculating the risk-based capital ratio.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-17" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-17">17</a>] </sup>
 These assets include:
</p>

<p>(i)(a) Goodwill—deducted from the sum of core capital elements.
</p>
<p>(b) Certain identifiable intangible assets, that is, intangible assets other than goodwill—deducted from the sum of core capital elements in accordance with section II.B.1.b. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>(c) Certain credit-enhancing interest-only strips receivables—deducted from the sum of core capital elements in accordance with sections II.B.1.c. through e. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>(ii) Investments in banking and finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for accounting or supervisory purposes, and investments in other designated subsidiaries or associated companies at the discretion of the Federal Reserve—deducted from total capital components (as described in greater detail below).
</p>
<p>(iii) Reciprocal holdings of capital instruments of banking organizations—deducted from total capital components.
</p>
<p>(iv) Deferred tax assets—portions are deducted from the sum of core capital elements in accordance with section II.B.4. of this appendix A.
</p>
<p>(v) Nonfinancial equity investments—portions are deducted from the sum of core capital elements in accordance with section II.<em>B.</em>5 of this appendix A.
</p>
<p>1. <em>Goodwill and other intangible assets</em>—a. <em>Goodwill.</em> Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is deducted from the sum of core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.
</p>
<p>b. <em>Other intangible assets.</em> i. All servicing assets, including servicing assets on assets other than mortgages (i.e., nonmortgage servicing assets), are included in this appendix as identifiable intangible assets. The only types of identifiable intangible assets that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, an organization's capital are readily marketable mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships. The total amount of these assets that may be included in capital is subject to the limitations described below in sections II.B.1.d. and e. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>ii. The treatment of identifiable intangible assets set forth in this section generally will be used in the calculation of a bank holding company's capital ratios for supervisory and applications purposes. However, in making an overall assessment of a bank holding company's capital adequacy for applications purposes, the Board may, if it deems appropriate, take into account the quality and composition of an organization's capital, together with the quality and value of its tangible and intangible assets.
</p>
<p>c. <em>Credit-enhancing interest-only strips receivables (I/Os)</em> i. Credit-enhancing I/Os are on-balance sheet assets that, in form or in substance, represent a contractual right to receive some or all of the interest due on transferred assets and expose the bank holding company to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with transferred assets that exceeds a <em>pro rata</em> share of the bank holding company's claim on the assets, whether through subordination provisions or other credit enhancement techniques. Such I/Os, whether purchased or retained, including other similar “spread” assets, may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a bank holding company's capital subject to the limitations described below in sections II.B.1.d. and e. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>ii. Both purchased and retained credit-enhancing I/Os, on a non-tax adjusted basis, are included in the total amount that is used for purposes of determining whether a bank holding company exceeds the tier 1 limitation described below in this section. In determining whether an I/O or other types of spread assets serve as a credit enhancement, the Federal Reserve will look to the economic substance of the transaction.
</p>
<p>d. <em>Fair value limitation.</em> The amount of mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships that a bank holding company may include in capital shall be the lesser of 90 percent of their fair value, as determined in accordance with section II.B.1.f. of this appendix, or 100 percent of their book value, as adjusted for capital purposes in accordance with the instructions to the Consolidated Financial Statements for Bank Holding Companies (FR Y–9C Report). The amount of credit-enhancing I/Os that a bank holding company may include in capital shall be its fair value. If both the application of the limits on mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships and the adjustment of the balance sheet amount for these assets would result in an amount being deducted from capital, the bank holding company would deduct only the greater of the two amounts from its core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital.
</p>
<p>e. <em>Tier 1 capital limitation.</em> i. The total amount of mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships that may be included in capital, in the aggregate, cannot exceed 100 percent of tier 1 capital. Nonmortgage servicing assets and purchased credit card relationships are subject, in the aggregate, to a separate sublimit of 25 percent of tier 1 capital. In addition, the total amount of credit-enhancing I/Os (both purchased and retained) that may be included in capital cannot exceed 25 percent of tier 1 capital.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-18" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-18">18</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>ii. For purposes of calculating these limitations on mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, and credit-enhancing I/Os, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements, net of goodwill, and net of all identifiable intangible assets other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships, but prior to the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os (both purchased and retained), any disallowed deferred tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments.
</p>
<p>iii. Bank holding companies may elect to deduct goodwill, disallowed mortgage servicing assets, disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, and disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os (both purchased and retained) on a basis that is net of any associated deferred tax liability. Deferred tax liabilities netted in this manner cannot also be netted against deferred tax assets when determining the amount of deferred tax assets that are dependent upon future taxable income.
</p>
<p>f. <em>Valuation.</em> Bank holding companies must review the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets at least quarterly and make adjustments to these values as necessary. The fair value of mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, purchased credit card relationships, and credit-enhancing I/Os also must be determined at least quarterly. This determination shall include adjustments for any significant changes in original valuation assumptions, including changes in prepayment estimates or account attrition rates. Examiners will review both the book value and the fair value assigned to these assets, together with supporting documentation, during the inspection process. In addition, the Federal Reserve may require, on a case-by-case basis, an independent valuation of a bank holding company's goodwill, other intangible assets, or credit-enhancing I/Os.
</p>
<p>g. <em>Growing organizations.</em> Consistent with long-standing Board policy, banking organizations experiencing substantial growth, whether internally or by acquisition, are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on intangible assets or credit-enhancing I/Os.
</p>
<p>2. <em>Investments in certain subsidiaries</em>— a. <em>Unconsolidated banking or finance subsidiaries.</em> The aggregate amount of investments in banking or finance subsidiaries<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-19" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-19">19</a>] </sup>
 whose financial statements are not consolidated for accounting or regulatory reporting purposes, regardless of whether the investment is made by the parent bank holding company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries, will be deducted from the consolidated parent banking organization's total capital components.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-20" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-20">20</a>] </sup>
 Generally, investments for this purpose are defined as equity and debt capital investments and any other instruments that are deemed to be capital in the particular subsidiary.
</p>


<p>Advances (that is, loans, extensions of credit, guarantees, commitments, or any other forms of credit exposure) to the subsidiary that are not deemed to be capital will generally not be deducted from an organization's capital. Rather, such advances generally will be included in the parent banking organization's consolidated assets and be assigned to the 100 percent risk category, unless such obligations are backed by recognized collateral or guarantees, in which case they will be assigned to the risk category appropriate to such collateral or guarantees. These advances may, however, also be deducted from the consolidated parent banking organization's capital if, in the judgment of the Federal Reserve, the risks stemming from such advances are comparable to the risks associated with capital investments or if the advances involve other risk factors that warrant such an adjustment to capital for supervisory purposes. These other factors could include, for example, the absence of collateral support.
</p>
<p>Inasmuch as the assets of unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries are not fully reflected in a banking organization's consolidated total assets, such assets may be viewed as the equivalent of off-balance sheet exposures since the operations of an unconsolidated subsidiary could expose the parent organization and its affiliates to considerable risk. For this reason, it is generally appropriate to view the capital resources invested in these unconsolidated entities as primarily supporting the risks inherent in these off-balance sheet assets, and not generally available to support risks or absorb losses elsewhere in the organization.
</p>
<p>b. <em>Other subsidiaries and investments.</em> The deduction of investments, regardless of whether they are made by the parent bank holding company or by its direct or indirect subsidiaries, from a consolidated banking organization's capital will also be applied in the case of any subsidiaries, that, while consolidated for accounting purposes, are not consolidated for certain specified supervisory or regulatory purposes, such as to facilitate functional regulation. For this purpose, aggregate capital investments (that is, the sum of any equity or debt instruments that are deemed to be capital) in these subsidiaries will be deducted from the consolidated parent banking organization's total capital components.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-21" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-21">21</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>Advances (that is, loans, extensions of credit, guarantees, commitments, or any other forms of credit exposure) to such subsidiaries that are not deemed to be capital will generally not be deducted from capital. Rather, such advances will normally be included in the parent banking organization's consolidated assets and assigned to the 100 percent risk category, unless such obligations are backed by recognized collateral or guarantees, in which case they will be assigned to the risk category appropriate to such collateral or guarantees. These advances may, however, be deducted from the consolidated parent banking organization's capital if, in the judgment of the Federal Reserve, the risks stemming from such advances are comparable to the risks associated with capital investments or if such advances involve other risk factors that warrant such an adjustment to capital for supervisory purposes. These other factors could include, for example, the absence of collateral support.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-22" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-22">22</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>In general, when investments in a consolidated subsidiary are deducted from a consolidated parent banking organization's capital, the subsidiary's assets will also be excluded from the consolidated assets of the parent banking organization in order to assess the latter's capital adequacy.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-23" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-23">23</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve may also deduct from a banking organization's capital, on a case-by-case basis, investments in certain other subsidiaries in order to determine if the consolidated banking organization meets minimum supervisory capital requirements without reliance on the resources invested in such subsidiaries.
</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve will not automatically deduct investments in other unconsolidated subsidiaries or investments in joint ventures and associated companies.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-24" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-24">24</a>] </sup>
 Nonetheless, the resources invested in these entities, like investments in unconsolidated banking and finance subsidiaries, support assets not consolidated with the rest of the banking organization's activities and, therefore, may not be generally available to support additional leverage or absorb losses elsewhere in the banking organization. Moreover, experience has shown that banking organizations stand behind the losses of affiliated institutions, such as joint ventures and associated companies, in order to protect the reputation of the organization as a whole. In some cases, this has led to losses that have exceeded the investments in such organizations.
</p>

<p>For this reason, the Federal Reserve will monitor the level and nature of such investments for individual banking organizations and may, on a case-by-case basis, deduct such investments from total capital components, apply an appropriate risk-weighted capital charge against the organization's proportionate share of the assets of its associated companies, require a line-by-line consolidation of the entity (in the event that the parent's control over the entity makes it the functional equivalent of a subsidiary), or otherwise require the organization to operate with a risk-based capital ratio above the minimum.
</p>
<p>In considering the appropriateness of such adjustments or actions, the Federal Reserve will generally take into account whether:
</p>
<p>(1) The parent banking organization has significant influence over the financial or managerial policies or operations of the subsidiary, joint venture, or associated company;
</p>
<p>(2) The banking organization is the largest investor in the affiliated company; or
</p>
<p>(3) Other circumstances prevail that appear to closely tie the activities of the affiliated company to the parent banking organization.
</p>
<p>3. <em>Reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital instruments.</em> Reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital instruments (that is, instruments that qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital) will be deducted from an organization's total capital components for the purpose of determining the numerator of the risk-based capital ratio.
</p>
<p>Reciprocal holdings are cross-holdings resulting from formal or informal arrangements in which two or more banking organizations swap, exchange, or otherwise agree to hold each other's capital instruments. Generally, deductions will be limited to intentional cross-holdings. At present, the Board does not intend to require banking organizations to deduct non-reciprocal holdings of such capital instruments.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-25" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-25">25</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>4. <em>Deferred-tax assets.</em> a. The amount of deferred-tax assets that is dependent upon future taxable income, net of the valuation allowance for deferred-tax assets, that may be included in, that is, not deducted from, a bank holding company's capital may not exceed the lesser of:
</p>
<p>i. The amount of these deferred-tax assets that the bank holding company is expected to realize within one year of the calendar quarter-end date, based on its projections of future taxable income for that year,<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-26" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-26">26</a>] </sup>
 or
</p>

<p>ii. 10 percent of tier 1 capital.
</p>
<p>b. The reported amount of deferred-tax assets, net of any valuation allowance for deferred-tax assets, in excess of the lesser of these two amounts is to be deducted from a banking organization's core capital elements in determining tier 1 capital. For purposes of calculating the 10 percent limitation, tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements, net of goodwill and net of all identifiable intangible assets other than mortgage servicing assets, nonmortgage servicing assets, and purchased credit card relationships, but prior to the deduction of any disallowed mortgage servicing assets, any disallowed nonmortgage servicing assets, any disallowed purchased credit card relationships, any disallowed credit-enhancing I/Os, any disallowed deferred-tax assets, and any nonfinancial equity investments. There generally is no limit in tier 1 capital on the amount of deferred-tax assets that can be realized from taxes paid in prior carry-back years or from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.
</p>
<p>5. <em>Nonfinancial equity investments</em>—a. <em>General.</em> A bank holding company must deduct from its core capital elements the sum of the appropriate percentages (as determined below) of the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments held by the parent bank holding company or by its direct or indirect subsidiaries. For purposes of this section II.B.5, investments held by a bank holding company include all investments held directly or indirectly by the bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries.
</p>
<p>b. <em>Scope of nonfinancial equity investments.</em> A nonfinancial equity investment means any equity investment held by the bank holding company: under the merchant banking authority of section 4(k)(4)(H) of the BHC Act and subpart J of the Board's Regulation Y (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-225.175" class="cfr external">12 CFR 225.175</a> <em>et seq.</em>); under section 4(c)(6) or 4(c)(7) of BHC Act in a nonfinancial company or in a company that makes investments in nonfinancial companies; in a nonfinancial company through a small business investment company (SBIC) under section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958;<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-27" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-27">27</a>] </sup>
 in a nonfinancial company under the portfolio investment provisions of the Board's Regulation K (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-211.8#p-211.8(c)(3)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 211.8(c)(3)</a>); or in a nonfinancial company under section 24 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (other than section 24(f)).<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-28" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-28">28</a>] </sup>
 A nonfinancial company is an entity that engages in any activity that has not been determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1843" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1843(k)</a>).
</p>


<p>c. <em>Amount of deduction from core capital.</em> i. The bank holding company must deduct from its core capital elements the sum of the appropriate percentages, as set forth in Table 1, of the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank holding company. The amount of the percentage deduction increases as the aggregate amount of nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank holding company increases as a percentage of the bank holding company's Tier 1 capital.

<p>ii. These deductions are applied on a marginal basis to the portions of the adjusted carrying value of nonfinancial equity investments that fall within the specified ranges of the parent holding company's Tier 1 capital. For example, if the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments held by a bank holding company equals 20 percent of the Tier 1 capital of the bank holding company, then the amount of the deduction would be 8 percent of the adjusted carrying value of all investments up to 15 percent of the company's Tier 1 capital, and 12 percent of the adjusted carrying value of all investments in excess of 15 percent of the company's Tier 1 capital.
</p>
<p>iii. The total adjusted carrying value of any nonfinancial equity investment that is subject to deduction under this paragraph is excluded from the bank holding company's risk-weighted assets for purposes of computing the denominator of the company's risk-based capital ratio.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-29" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-29">29</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>iv. As noted in section I, this appendix establishes <em>minimum</em> risk-based capital ratios and banking organizations are at all times expected to maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of the risks to which they are exposed. The risk to a banking organization from nonfinancial equity investments increases with its concentration in such investments and strong capital levels above the minimum requirements are particularly important when a banking organization has a high degree of concentration in nonfinancial equity investments (<em>e.g.,</em> in excess of 50 percent of Tier 1 capital). The Federal Reserve intends to monitor banking organizations and apply heightened supervision to equity investment activities as appropriate, including where the banking organization has a high degree of concentration in nonfinancial equity investments, to ensure that each organization maintains capital levels that are appropriate in light of its equity investment activities. The Federal Reserve also reserves authority to impose a higher capital charge in any case where the circumstances, such as the level of risk of the particular investment or portfolio of investments, the risk management systems of the banking organization, or other information, indicate that a higher minimum capital requirement is appropriate.
</p>
<p>d. <em>SBIC investments.</em> i. No deduction is required for nonfinancial equity investments that are held by a bank holding company through one or more SBICs that are consolidated with the bank holding company or in one or more SBICs that are not consolidated with the bank holding company to the extent that all such investments, in the aggregate, do not exceed 15 percent of the aggregate of the bank holding company's pro rata interests in the Tier 1 capital of its subsidiary banks. Any nonfinancial equity investment that is held through or in an SBIC and not required to be deducted from Tier 1 capital under this section II.B.5.d. will be assigned a 100 percent risk-weight and included in the parent holding company's consolidated risk-weighted assets.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-30" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-30">30</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>ii. To the extent the adjusted carrying value of all nonfinancial equity investments that a bank holding company holds through one or more SBICs that are consolidated with the bank holding company or in one or more SBICs that are not consolidated with the bank holding company exceeds, in the aggregate, 15 percent of the aggregate Tier 1 capital of the company's subsidiary banks, the appropriate percentage of such amounts (as set forth in Table 1) must be deducted from the bank holding company's core capital elements. In addition, the aggregate adjusted carrying value of <em>all</em> nonfinancial equity investments held through a consolidated SBIC and in a non-consolidated SBIC (including any investments for which no deduction is required) must be included in determining, for purposes of Table 1, the total amount of nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank holding company in relation to its Tier 1 capital.
</p>
<p>e. <em>Transition provisions.</em> No deduction under this section II.<em>B.</em>5 is required to be made with respect to the adjusted carrying value of any nonfinancial equity investment (or portion of such an investment) that was made by the bank holding company prior to March 13, 2000, or that was made after such date pursuant to a binding written commitment<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-31" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-31">31</a>] </sup>
 entered into by the bank holding company prior to March 13, 2000, provided that in either case the bank holding company has continuously held the investment since the relevant investment date.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-32" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-32">32</a>] </sup>
 For purposes of this section II.B.5.e., a nonfinancial equity investment made prior to March 13, 2000, includes any shares or other interests received by the bank holding company through a stock split or stock dividend on an investment made prior to March 13, 2000, provided the bank holding company provides no consideration for the shares or interests received and the transaction does not materially increase the bank” holding company's proportional interest in the company. The exercise on or after March 13, 2000, of options or warrants acquired prior to March 13, 2000, is <em>not</em> considered to be an investment made prior to March 13, 2000, if the bank holding company provides any consideration for the shares or interests received upon exercise of the options or warrants. Any nonfinancial equity investment (or portion thereof) that is not required to be deducted from Tier 1 capital under this section II.B.5.e. must be included in determining the total amount of nonfinancial equity investments held by the bank holding company in relation to its Tier 1 capital for purposes of Table 1. In addition, any nonfinancial equity investment (or portion thereof) that is not required to be deducted from Tier 1 capital under this section II.B.5.e. will be assigned a 100-percent risk weight and included in the bank holding company's consolidated risk-weighted assets.
</p>


<p>f. <em>Adjusted carrying value.</em> i. For purposes of this section II.<em>B.</em>5., the “adjusted carrying value” of investments is the aggregate value at which the investments are carried on the balance sheet of the consolidated bank holding company reduced by any unrealized gains on those investments that are reflected in such carrying value but excluded from the bank holding company's Tier 1 capital and associated deferred tax liabilities. For example, for investments held as available-for-sale (AFS), the adjusted carrying value of the investments would be the aggregate carrying value of the investments (as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the bank holding company) <em>less</em> any unrealized gains on those investments that are included in other comprehensive income and not reflected in Tier 1 capital, and associated deferred tax liabilities.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-33" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-33">33</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>ii. As discussed above with respect to consolidated SBICs, some equity investments may be in companies that are consolidated for accounting purposes. For investments in a nonfinancial company that is consolidated for accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles, the parent banking organization's adjusted carrying value of the investment is determined under the equity method of accounting (net of any intangibles associated with the investment that are deducted from the consolidated bank holding company's core capital in accordance with section II.B.1 of this appendix). Even though the assets of the nonfinancial company are consolidated for accounting purposes, these assets (as well as the credit equivalent amounts of the company's off-balance sheet items) should be excluded from the banking organization's risk-weighted assets for regulatory capital purposes.
</p>
<p>g. <em>Equity investments.</em> For purposes of this section II.<em>B.</em>5, an equity investment means any equity instrument (including common stock, preferred stock, partnership interests, interests in limited liability companies, trust certificates and warrants and call options that give the holder the right to purchase an equity instrument), any equity feature of a debt instrument (such as a warrant or call option), and any debt instrument that is convertible into equity where the instrument or feature is held under one of the legal authorities listed in section II.<em>B.</em>5.b. of this appendix. An investment in any other instrument (including subordinated debt) may be treated as an equity investment if, in the judgment of the Federal Reserve, the instrument is the functional equivalent of equity or exposes the state member bank to essentially the same risks as an equity instrument.

<p class="hd1-paragraph">III. Procedures for Computing Weighted Risk Assets and Off-Balance Sheet Items
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">A. Procedures
</p>
<p>Assets and credit equivalent amounts of off-balance sheet items of bank holding companies are assigned to one of several broad risk categories, according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral. The aggregate dollar value of the amount in each category is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that category. The resulting weighted values from each of the risk categories are added together, and this sum is the banking organization's total weighted risk assets that comprise the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio. Attachment I provides a sample calculation.
</p>
<p>Risk weights for all off-balance sheet items are determined by a two-step process. First, the “credit equivalent amount” of off-balance sheet items is determined, in most cases, by multiplying the off-balance sheet item by a credit conversion factor. Second, the credit equivalent amount is treated like any balance sheet asset and generally is assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of the collateral.
</p>
<p>In general, if a particular item qualifies for placement in more than one risk category, it is assigned to the category that has the lowest risk weight. A holding of a U.S. municipal revenue bond that is fully guaranteed by a U.S. bank, for example, would be assigned the 20 percent risk weight appropriate to claims guaranteed by U.S. banks, rather than the 50 percent risk weight appropriate to U.S. municipal revenue bonds.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-34" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-34">34</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve will, on a case-by-case basis, determine the appropriate risk weight for any asset or credit equivalent amount of an off-balance sheet item that does not fit wholly within the terms of one of the risk weight categories set forth below or that imposes risks on a bank holding company that are incommensurate with the risk weight otherwise specified below for the asset or off-balance sheet item. In addition, the Federal Reserve will, on a case-by-case basis, determine the appropriate credit conversion factor for any off-balance sheet item that does not fit wholly within the terms of one of the credit conversion factors set forth below or that imposes risks on a banking organization that are incommensurate with the credit conversion factors otherwise specified below for the off-balance sheet item. In making such a determination, the Federal Reserve will consider the similarity of the asset or off-balance sheet item to assets or off-balance sheet items explicitly treated in the guidelines, as well as other relevant factors.
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">B. Collateral, Guarantees, and Other Considerations
</p>
<p>1. <em>Collateral.</em> The only forms of collateral that are formally recognized by the risk-based capital framework are: Cash on deposit in a subsidiary lending institution; securities issued or guaranteed by the central governments of the OECD-based group of countries,<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-35" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-35">35</a>] </sup>
 U.S. Government agencies, or U.S. Government-sponsored agencies; and securities issued by multilateral lending institutions or regional development banks. Claims fully secured by such collateral generally are assigned to the 20 percent risk-weight category. Collateralized transactions meeting all the conditions described in section III.C.1. may be assigned a zero percent risk weight.
</p>

<p>With regard to collateralized claims that may be assigned to the 20 percent risk-weight category, the extent to which qualifying securities are recognized as collateral is determined by their current market value. If such a claim is only partially secured, that is, the market value of the pledged securities is less than the face amount of a balance-sheet asset or an off-balance-sheet item, the portion that is covered by the market value of the qualifying collateral is assigned to the 20 percent risk category, and the portion of the claim that is not covered by collateral in the form of cash or a qualifying security is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor. For example, to the extent that a claim on a private sector obligor is collateralized by the current market value of U.S. Government securities, it would be placed in the 20 percent risk category and the balance would be assigned to the 100 percent risk category.
</p>
<p>2. <em>Guarantees.</em> Guarantees of the OECD and non-OECD central governments, U.S. Government agencies, U.S. Government-sponsored agencies, state and local governments of the OECD-based group of countries, multilateral lending institutions and regional development banks, U.S. depository institutions, and foreign banks are also recognized. If a claim is partially guaranteed, that is, coverage of the guarantee is less than the face amount of a balance sheet asset or an off-balance sheet item, the portion that is not fully covered by the guarantee is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor or, if relevant, to any collateral. The face amount of a claim covered by two types of guarantees that have different risk weights, such as a U.S. Government guarantee and a state guarantee, is to be apportioned between the two risk categories appropriate to the guarantors.
</p>
<p>The existence of other forms of collateral or guarantees that the risk-based capital framework does not formally recognize may be taken into consideration in evaluating the risks inherent in an organization's loan portfolio—which, in turn, would affect the overall supervisory assessment of the organization's capital adequacy.
</p>
<p>3. <em>Recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests, and asset- and mortgage-backed securities.</em> Direct credit substitutes, assets transferred with recourse, and securities issued in connection with asset securitizations and structured financings are treated as described below. The term “asset securitizations” or “securitizations” in this rule includes structured financings, as well as asset securitization transactions.
</p>
<p>a. <em>Definitions</em>—i. <em>Credit derivative</em> means a contract that allows one party (the “protection purchaser”) to transfer the credit risk of an asset or off-balance sheet credit exposure to another party (the “protection provider”). The value of a credit derivative is dependent, at least in part, on the credit performance of the “reference asset.”
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Credit-enhancing representations and warranties</em> means representations and warranties that are made or assumed in connection with a transfer of assets (including loan servicing assets) and that obligate the bank holding company to protect investors from losses arising from credit risk in the assets transferred or the loans serviced. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties include promises to protect a party from losses resulting from the default or nonperformance of another party or from an insufficiency in the value of the collateral. Credit-enhancing representations and warranties do not include:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> Early default clauses and similar warranties that permit the return of, or premium refund clauses covering, 1–4 family residential first mortgage loans that qualify for a 50 percent risk weight for a period not to exceed 120 days from the date of transfer. These warranties may cover only those loans that were originated within 1 year of the date of transfer;
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> Premium refund clauses that cover assets guaranteed, in whole or in part, by the U.S. Government, a U.S. Government agency or a government-sponsored enterprise, provided the premium refund clauses are for a period not to exceed 120 days from the date of transfer; or
</p>
<p><em>3.</em> Warranties that permit the return of assets in instances of misrepresentation, fraud or incomplete documentation.
</p>
<p>iii. <em>Direct credit substitute</em> means an arrangement in which a bank holding company assumes, in form or in substance, credit risk associated with an on- or off-balance sheet credit exposure that was not previously owned by the bank holding company (third-party asset) and the risk assumed by the bank holding company exceeds the pro rata share of the bank holding company's interest in the third-party asset. If the bank holding company has no claim on the third-party asset, then the bank holding company's assumption of any credit risk with respect to the third party asset is a direct credit substitute. Direct credit substitutes include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> Financial standby letters of credit that support financial claims on a third party that exceed a bank holding company's pro rata share of losses in the financial claim;
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> Guarantees, surety arrangements, credit derivatives, and similar instruments backing financial claims that exceed a bank holding company's pro rata share in the financial claim;
</p>
<p><em>3.</em> Purchased subordinated interests or securities that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets;
</p>
<p><em>4.</em> Credit derivative contracts under which the bank holding company assumes more than its pro rata share of credit risk on a third party exposure;
</p>
<p><em>5.</em> Loans or lines of credit that provide credit enhancement for the financial obligations of an account party;
</p>
<p><em>6.</em> Purchased loan servicing assets if the servicer is responsible for credit losses or if the servicer makes or assumes credit-enhancing representations and warranties with respect to the loans serviced. Mortgage servicer cash advances that meet the conditions of section III.B.3.a.viii. of this appendix are not direct credit substitutes;
</p>
<p><em>7.</em> Clean-up calls on third party assets. Clean-up calls that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance that are exercisable at the option of the bank holding company are not direct credit substitutes; and
</p>
<p><em>8.</em> Liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP (other than eligible ABCP liquidity facilities).
</p>
<p>iv. <em>Eligible ABCP liquidity facility</em> means a liquidity facility supporting ABCP, in form or in substance, that is subject to an asset quality test at the time of draw that precludes funding against assets that are 90 days or more past due or in default. In addition, if the assets that an eligible ABCP liquidity facility is required to fund against are externally rated assets or exposures at the inception of the facility, the facility can be used to fund only those assets or exposures that are externally rated investment grade at the time of funding. Notwithstanding the eligibility requirements set forth in the two preceding sentences, a liquidity facility will be considered an eligible ABCP liquidity facility if the assets that are funded under the liquidity facility and which do not meet the eligibility requirements are guaranteed, either conditionally or unconditionally, by the U.S. government or its agencies, or by the central government of an OECD country.
</p>
<p>v. <em>Externally rated</em> means that an instrument or obligation has received a credit rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization.
</p>
<p>vi. <em>Face amount</em> means the notional principal, or face value, amount of an off-balance sheet item; the amortized cost of an asset not held for trading purposes; and the fair value of a trading asset.
</p>
<p>vii. <em>Financial asset</em> means cash or other monetary instrument, evidence of debt, evidence of an ownership interest in an entity, or a contract that conveys a right to receive or exchange cash or another financial instrument from another party.
</p>
<p>viii. <em>Financial standby letter of credit</em> means a letter of credit or similar arrangement that represents an irrevocable obligation to a third-party beneficiary:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> To repay money borrowed by, or advanced to, or for the account of, a second party (the account party), or
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> To make payment on behalf of the account party, in the event that the account party fails to fulfill its obligation to the beneficiary.
</p>
<p>ix. <em>Liquidity Facility</em> means a legally binding commitment to provide liquidity support to ABCP by lending to, or purchasing assets from, any structure, program, or conduit in the event that funds are required to repay maturing ABCP.
</p>
<p>x. <em>Mortgage servicer cash advance</em> means funds that a residential mortgage loan servicer advances to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments, including advances made to cover foreclosure costs or other expenses to facilitate the timely collection of the loan. A mortgage servicer cash advance is not a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute if:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> The servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is not subordinated to other claims on the cash flows from the underlying asset pool; or
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> For any one loan, the servicer's obligation to make nonreimbursable advances is contractually limited to an insignificant amount of the outstanding principal balance of that loan.
</p>
<p>xi. <em>Nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO)</em> means an entity recognized by the Division of Market Regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor Division) (Commission) as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization for various purposes, including the Commission's uniform net capital requirements for brokers and dealers.
</p>
<p>xii. <em>Recourse</em> means the retention, by a bank holding company, in form or in substance, of any credit risk directly or indirectly associated with an asset it has transferred and sold that exceeds a pro rata share of the banking organization's claim on the asset. If a banking organization has no claim on a transferred asset, then the retention of any risk of credit loss is recourse. A recourse obligation typically arises when a bank holding company transfers assets and retains an explicit obligation to repurchase the assets or absorb losses due to a default on the payment of principal or interest or any other deficiency in the performance of the underlying obligor or some other party. Recourse may also exist implicitly if a bank holding company provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold. The following are examples of recourse arrangements:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> Credit-enhancing representations and warranties made on the transferred assets;
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> Loan servicing assets retained pursuant to an agreement under which the bank holding company will be responsible for credit losses associated with the loans being serviced. Mortgage servicer cash advances that meet the conditions of section III.B.3.a.x. of this appendix are not recourse arrangements;
</p>
<p><em>3.</em> Retained subordinated interests that absorb more than their pro rata share of losses from the underlying assets;
</p>
<p><em>4.</em> Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase, if the assets are not already included on the balance sheet;
</p>
<p><em>5.</em> Loan strips sold without contractual recourse where the maturity of the transferred loan is shorter than the maturity of the commitment under which the loan is drawn;
</p>
<p><em>6.</em> Credit derivatives issued that absorb more than the bank holding company's pro rata share of losses from the transferred assets;
</p>
<p><em>7.</em> Clean-up calls at inception that are greater than 10 percent of the balance of the original pool of transferred loans. Clean-up calls that are 10 percent or less of the original pool balance that are exercisable at the option of the bank holding company are not recourse arrangements; and
</p>
<p><em>8.</em> Liquidity facilities that provide liquidity support to ABCP (other than eligible ABCP liquidity facilities).
</p>
<p>xiii. <em>Residual interest</em> means any on-balance sheet asset that represents an interest (including a beneficial interest) created by a transfer that qualifies as a sale (in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles) of financial assets, whether through a securitization or otherwise, and that exposes the bank holding company to credit risk directly or indirectly associated with the transferred assets that exceeds a pro rata share of the bank holding company's claim on the assets, whether through subordination provisions or other credit enhancement techniques. Residual interests generally include credit-enhancing I/Os, spread accounts, cash collateral accounts, retained subordinated interests, other forms of over-collateralization, and similar assets that function as a credit enhancement. Residual interests further include those exposures that, in substance, cause the bank holding company to retain the credit risk of an asset or exposure that had qualified as a residual interest before it was sold. Residual interests generally do not include interests purchased from a third party, except that purchased credit-enhancing I/Os are residual interests for purposes of this appendix.
</p>
<p>xiv. <em>Risk participation</em> means a participation in which the originating party remains liable to the beneficiary for the full amount of an obligation (<em>e.g.</em>, a direct credit substitute) notwithstanding that another party has acquired a participation in that obligation.
</p>
<p>xv. <em>Securitization</em> means the pooling and repackaging by a special purpose entity of assets or other credit exposures into securities that can be sold to investors. Securitization includes transactions that create stratified credit risk positions whose performance is dependent upon an underlying pool of credit exposures, including loans and commitments.
</p>
<p>xvi. <em>Sponsor</em> means a bank holding company that establishes an ABCP program; approves the sellers permitted to participate in the program; approves the asset pools to be purchased by the program; or administers the program by monitoring the assets, arranging for debt placement, compiling monthly reports, or ensuring compliance with the program documents and with the program's credit and investment policy.
</p>
<p>xvii. <em>Structured finance program</em> means a program where receivable interests and asset-backed securities issued by multiple participants are purchased by a special purpose entity that repackages those exposures into securities that can be sold to investors. Structured finance programs allocate credit risks, generally, between the participants and credit enhancement provided to the program.
</p>
<p>xviii. <em>Traded position</em> means a position that is externally rated and is retained, assumed, or issued in connection with an asset securitization, where there is a reasonable expectation that, in the near future, the rating will be relied upon by unaffiliated investors to purchase the position; or an unaffiliated third party to enter into a transaction involving the position, such as a purchase, loan, or repurchase agreement.
</p>
<p>b. <em>Credit equivalent amounts and risk weight of recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes.</em> i. <em>Credit equivalent amount.</em> Except as otherwise provided in sections III.B.3.c. through f. and III.B.5. of this appendix, the credit-equivalent amount for a recourse obligation or direct credit substitute is the full amount of the credit-enhanced assets for which the bank holding company directly or indirectly retains or assumes credit risk multiplied by a 100 percent conversion factor.
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Risk-weight factor.</em> To determine the bank holding company's risk-weight factor for off-balance sheet recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes, the credit equivalent amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral. For a direct credit substitute that is an on-balance sheet asset (<em>e.g.,</em> a purchased subordinated security), a bank holding company must calculate risk-weighted assets using the amount of the direct credit substitute and the full amount of the assets it supports, <em>i.e.,</em> all the more senior positions in the structure. The treatment of direct credit substitutes that have been syndicated or in which risk participations have been conveyed or acquired is set forth in section III.D.1 of this appendix.
</p>
<p>c. <em>Externally-rated positions: credit-equivalent amounts and risk weights of recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests, and asset- and mortgage-backed securities (including asset-backed commercial paper)</em>—i. <em>Traded positions.</em> With respect to a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest (other than a credit-enhancing I/Ostrip) or asset- and mortgage-backed security (including asset-backed commercial paper) that is a traded position and that has received an external rating on a long-term position that is one grade below investment grade or better or a short-term rating that is investment grade, the bank holding company may multiply the face amount of the position by the appropriate risk weight, determined in accordance with the tables below. Stripped mortgage-backed securities and other similar instruments, such as interest-only or principal-only strips that are not credit enhancements, must be assigned to the 100 percent risk category. If a traded position has received more than one external rating, the lowest single rating will apply.
</p>

<p>ii. <em>Non-traded positions.</em> A recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, or residual interest (but not a credit-enhancing I/O strip) extended in connection with a securitization that is not a traded position may be assigned a risk weight in accordance with section III.B.3.c.i. of this appendix if:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> It has been externally rated by more than one NRSRO;
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> It has received an external rating on a long-term position that is one grade below investment grade or better or on a short-term position that is investment grade by all NRSROs providing a rating;
</p>
<p><em>3.</em> The ratings are publicly available; and
</p>
<p><em>4.</em> The ratings are based on the same criteria used to rate traded positions.
</p>
<p>If the ratings are different, the lowest rating will determine the risk category to which the recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, or residual interest will be assigned.
</p>
<p>d. <em>Senior positions not externally rated.</em> For a recourse obligation, direct credit substitute, residual interest, or asset-or mortgage-backed security that is not externally rated but is senior or preferred in all features to a traded position (including collateralization and maturity), a bank holding company may apply a risk weight to the face amount of the senior position in accordance with section III.B.3.c.i. of this appendix, based on the traded position, subject to any current or prospective supervisory guidance and the bank holding company satisfying the Federal Reserve that this treatment is appropriate. This section will apply only if the traded subordinated position provides substantive credit support to the unrated position until the unrated position matures.
</p>
<p>e. <em>Capital requirement for residual interests</em>—i. <em>Capital requirement for credit-enhancing I/O strips.</em> After applying the concentration limit to credit-enhancing I/O strips (both purchased and retained) in accordance with sections II.B.2.c. through e. of this appendix, a bank holding company must maintain risk-based capital for a credit-enhancing I/O strip (both purchased and retained), regardless of the external rating on that position, equal to the remaining amount of the credit-enhancing I/O (net of any existing associated deferred tax liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital required to be maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred. Transactions that, in substance, result in the retention of credit risk associated with a transferred credit-enhancing I/O strip will be treated as if the credit-enhancing I/O strip was retained by the bank holding company and not transferred.
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Capital requirement for other residual interests. 1.</em> If a residual interest does not meet the requirements of sections III.B.3.c. or d. of this appendix, a bank holding must maintain risk-based capital equal to the remaining amount of the residual interest that is retained on the balance sheet (net of any existing associated deferred tax liability), even if the amount of risk-based capital required to be maintained exceeds the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred. Transactions that, in substance, result in the retention of credit risk associated with a transferred residual interest will be treated as if the residual interest was retained by the bank holding company and not transferred.
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> Where the aggregate capital requirement for residual interests and other recourse obligations in connection with the same transfer of assets exceed the full risk-based capital requirement for those assets, a bank holding company must maintain risk-based capital equal to the greater of the risk-based capital requirement for the residual interest as calculated under section III.B.3.e.ii.<em>1.</em> of this appendix or the full risk-based capital requirement for the assets transferred.
</p>
<p>f. <em>Positions that are not rated by an NRSRO.</em> A position (but not a residual interest) maintained in connection with a securitization and that is not rated by a NRSRO may be risk-weighted based on the bank holding company's determination of the credit rating of the position, as specified in the table below, multiplied by the face amount of the position. In order to obtain this treatment, the bank holding company's system for determining the credit rating of the position must meet one of the three alternative standards set out in sections III.B.3.f.i. through III.B.3.f.iii. of this appendix.

<p>i. <em>Internal risk rating used for asset-backed programs.</em> A direct credit substitute (other than a purchased credit-enhancing I/O) is assumed in connection with an asset-backed commercial paper program sponsored by the bank holding company and the bank holding company is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Federal Reserve, prior to relying upon its use, that the bank holding company's internal credit risk rating system is adequate. Adequate internal credit risk rating systems usually contain the following criteria:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> The internal credit risk system is an integral part of the bank holding company's risk management system, which explicitly incorporates the full range of risks arising from a bank holding company's participation in securitization activities;
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> Internal credit ratings are linked to measurable outcomes, such as the probability that the position will experience any loss, the position's expected loss given default, and the degree of variance in losses given default on that position;
</p>
<p><em>3.</em> The bank holding company's internal credit risk system must separately consider the risk associated with the underlying loans or borrowers, and the risk associated with the structure of a particular securitization transaction;
</p>
<p><em>4.</em> The bank holding company's internal credit risk system must identify gradations of risk among “pass” assets and other risk positions;
</p>
<p><em>5.</em> The bank holding company must have clear, explicit criteria that are used to classify assets into each internal risk grade, including subjective factors;
</p>
<p><em>6.</em> The bank holding company must have independent credit risk management or loan review personnel assigning or reviewing the credit risk ratings;
</p>
<p><em>7.</em> The bank holding company must have an internal audit procedure that periodically verifies that the internal credit risk ratings are assigned in accordance with the established criteria;
</p>
<p><em>8.</em> The bank holding company must monitor the performance of the internal credit risk ratings assigned to nonrated, nontraded direct credit substitutes over time to determine the appropriateness of the initial credit risk rating assignment and adjust individual credit risk ratings, or the overall internal credit risk ratings system, as needed; and
</p>
<p><em>9.</em> The internal credit risk system must make credit risk rating assumptions that are consistent with, or more conservative than, the credit risk rating assumptions and methodologies of NRSROs.
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Program Ratings.</em> A direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (other than a residual interest) is assumed or retained in connection with a structured finance program and a NRSRO has reviewed the terms of the program and stated a rating for positions associated with the program. If the program has options for different combinations of assets, standards, internal credit enhancements and other relevant factors, and the NRSRO specifies ranges of rating categories to them, the bank holding company may apply the rating category that corresponds to the bank holding company's position. In order to rely on a program rating, the bank holding company must demonstrate to the Federal Reserve's satisfaction that the credit risk rating assigned to the program meets the same standards generally used by NRSROs for rating traded positions. The bank holding company must also demonstrate to the Federal Reserve's satisfaction that the criteria underlying the NRSRO's assignment of ratings for the program are satisfied for the particular position. If a bank holding company participates in a securitization sponsored by another party, the Federal Reserve may authorize the bank holding company to use this approach based on a programmatic rating obtained by the sponsor of the program.
</p>
<p>iii. <em>Computer Program.</em> The bank holding company is using an acceptable credit assessment computer program to determine the rating of a direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (but not residual interest) issued in connection with a structured finance program. A NRSRO must have developed the computer program, and the bank holding company must demonstrate to the Federal Reserve's satisfaction that ratings under the program correspond credibly and reliably with the rating of traded positions.
</p>
<p>g. <em>Limitations on risk-based capital requirements</em>—i. <em>Low-level exposure.</em> If the maximum contractual exposure to loss retained or assumed by a bank holding company in connection with a recourse obligation or a direct credit substitute is less than the effective risk-based capital requirement for the enhanced assets, the risk-based capital requirement is limited to the maximum contractual exposure, less any liability account established in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. This limitation does not apply when a bank holding company provides credit enhancement beyond any contractual obligation to support assets it has sold.
</p>
<p>ii. <em>Mortgage-related securities or participation certificates retained in a mortgage loan swap.</em> If a bank holding company holds a mortgage-related security or a participation certificate as a result of a mortgage loan swap with recourse, capital is required to support the recourse obligation plus the percentage of the mortgage-related security or participation certificate that is not covered by the recourse obligation. The total amount of capital required for the on-balance sheet asset and the recourse obligation, however, is limited to the capital requirement for the underlying loans, calculated as if the organization continued to hold these loans as on-balance sheet assets.
</p>
<p>iii. <em>Related on-balance sheet assets.</em> If a recourse obligation or direct credit substitute subject to section III.B.3. of this appendix also appears as a balance sheet asset, the balance sheet asset is not included in an organization's risk-weighted assets to the extent the value of the balance sheet asset is already included in the off-balance sheet credit equivalent amount for the recourse obligation or direct credit substitute, except in the case of loan servicing assets and similar arrangements with embedded recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes. In that case, both the on-balance sheet assets and the related recourse obligations and direct credit substitutes are incorporated into the risk-based capital calculation.
</p>
<p>4. <em>Maturity.</em> Maturity is generally not a factor in assigning items to risk categories with the exception of claims on non-OECD banks, commitments, and interest rate and foreign exchange rate contracts. Except for commitments, short-term is defined as one year or less <em>remaining</em> maturity and long-term is defined as over one year <em>remaining</em> maturity. In the case of commitments, short-term is defined as one year or less <em>original</em> maturity and long-term is defined as over one year <em>original</em> maturity.
</p>
<p>5. <em>Small Business Loans and Leases on Personal Property Transferred with Recourse.</em> a. Notwithstanding other provisions of this appendix A, a qualifying banking organization that has transferred small business loans and leases on personal property (small business obligations) with recourse shall include in weighted-risk assets only the amount of retained recourse, provided two conditions are met. First, the transaction must be treated as a sale under GAAP and, second, the banking organization must establish pursuant to GAAP a non-capital reserve sufficient to meet the organization's reasonably estimated liability under the recourse arrangement. Only loans and leases to businesses that meet the criteria for a small business concern established by the Small Business Administration under section 3(a) of the Small Business Act are eligible for this capital treatment.
</p>
<p>b. For purposes of this appendix A, a banking organization is qualifying if it meets the criteria for well capitalized or, by order of the Board, adequately capitalized, as those criteria are set forth in the Board's prompt corrective action regulation for state member banks (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-208.40" class="cfr external">12 CFR 208.40</a>). For purposes of determining whether an organization meets these criteria, its capital ratios must be calculated without regard to the capital treatment for transfers of small business obligations with recourse specified in section III.B.5.a. of this appendix A. The total outstanding amount of recourse retained by a qualifying banking organization on transfers of small business obligations receiving the preferential capital treatment cannot exceed 15 percent of the organization's total risk-based capital. By order, the Board may approve a higher limit.
</p>
<p>c. If a bank holding company ceases to be qualifying or exceeds the 15 percent capital limitation, the preferential capital treatment will continue to apply to any transfers of small business obligations with recourse that were consummated during the time that the organization was qualifying and did not exceed the capital limit.
</p>
<p>6. <em>Asset-backed commercial paper programs.</em> a. An asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) program means a program that primarily issues externally rated commercial paper backed by assets or exposures held in a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity.
</p>
<p>b. If a bank holding company has multiple overlapping exposures (such as a program-wide credit enhancement and multiple pool-specific liquidity facilities) to an ABCP program that is not consolidated for risk-based capital purposes, the bank holding company is not required to hold duplicative risk-based capital under this appendix against the overlapping position. Instead, the bank holding company should apply to the overlapping position the applicable risk-based capital treatment that results in the highest capital charge.
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">C. Risk Weights
</p>
<p>Attachment III contains a listing of the risk categories, a summary of the types of assets assigned to each category and the risk weight associated with each category, that is, 0 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent, and 100 percent. A brief explanation of the components of each category follows.
</p>
<p>1. <em>Category 1: zero percent.</em> This category includes cash (domestic and foreign) owned and held in all offices of subsidiary depository institutions or in transit and gold bullion held in either a subsidiary depository institution's own vaults or in another's vaults on an allocated basis, to the extent it is offset by gold bullion liabilities.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-36" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-36">36</a>] </sup>
 The category also includes all direct claims (including securities, loans, and leases) on, and the portions of claims that are directly and unconditionally guaranteed by, the central governments<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-37" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-37">37</a>] </sup>
 of the OECD countries and U.S. Government agencies,<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-38" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-38">38</a>] </sup>
 as well as all direct local currency claims on, and the portions of local currency claims that are directly and unconditionally guaranteed by, the central governments of non-OECD countries, to the extent that subsidiary depository institutions have liabilities booked in that currency. A claim is not considered to be unconditionally guaranteed by a central government if the validity of the guarantee is dependent upon some affirmative action by the holder or a third party. Generally, securities guaranteed by the U.S. Government or its agencies that are actively traded in financial markets, such as GNMA securities, are considered to be unconditionally guaranteed.
</p>



<p>This category also includes claims collateralized by cash on deposit in the subsidiary lending institution or by securities issued or guaranteed by OECD central governments or U.S. government agencies for which a positive margin of collateral is maintained on a daily basis, fully taking into account any change in the banking organization's exposure to the obligor or counterparty under a claim in relation to the market value of the collateral held in support of that claim.
</p>
<p>This category also includes ABCP (i) purchased by a bank holding company on or after September 19, 2008, from an SEC-registered open-end investment company that holds itself out as a money market mutual fund under SEC Rule 2a–7 (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-17/section-270.2a-7" class="cfr external">17 CFR 270.2a–7</a>) and (ii) pledged by the bank holding company to a Federal Reserve Bank to secure financing from the ABCP lending facility (AMLF) established by the Board on September 19, 2008.
</p>
<p>2. <em>Category 2: 20 percent.</em> a. This category includes cash items in the process of collection, both foreign and domestic; short-term claims (including demand deposits) on, and the portions of short-term claims that are guaranteed by,<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-39" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-39">39</a>] </sup>
 U.S. depository institutions<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-40" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-40">40</a>] </sup>
 and foreign banks<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-41" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-41">41</a>] </sup>
; and long-term claims on, and the portions of long-term claims that are guaranteed by, U.S. depository institutions and OECD banks.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-42" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-42">42</a>] </sup>

</p>




<p>b. This category also includes the portions of claims that are conditionally guaranteed by OECD central governments and U.S. Government agencies, as well as the portions of local currency claims that are conditionally guaranteed by non-OECD central governments, to the extent that subsidiary depository institutions have liabilities booked in that currency. In addition, this category also includes claims on, and the portions of claims that are guaranteed by, U.S. government-sponsored<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-43" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-43">43</a>] </sup>
 agencies and claims on, and the portions of claims guaranteed by, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (World Bank), the International Finance Corporation, the Interamerican Development Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Nordic Investment Bank, and other multilateral lending institutions or regional development banks in which the U.S. government is a shareholder or contributing member. General obligation claims on, or portions of claims guaranteed by the full faith and credit of, states or other political subdivisions of the U.S. or other countries of the OECD—based group are also assigned to this category.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-44" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-44">44</a>] </sup>

</p>


<p>c. This category also includes the portions of claims (including repurchase transactions) collateralized by cash on deposit in the subsidiary lending institution or by securities issued or guaranteed by OECD central governments or U.S. government agencies that do not qualify for the zero percent risk-weight category; collateralized by securities issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored agencies; or collateralized by securities issued by multilateral lending institutions or regional development banks in which the U.S. government is a shareholder or contributing member.
</p>
<p>d. This category also includes claims<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-45" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-45">45</a>] </sup>
 on, or guaranteed by, a qualifying securities firm<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-46" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-46">46</a>] </sup>
 incorporated in the United States or other member of the OECD-based group of countries provided that: the qualifying securities firm has a long-term issuer credit rating, or a rating on at least one issue of long-term debt, in one of the three highest investment grade rating categories from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization; or the claim is guaranteed by the firm's parent company and the parent company has such a rating. If ratings are available from more than one rating agency, the lowest rating will be used to determine whether the rating requirement has been met. This category also includes a collateralized claim on a qualifying securities firm in such a country, without regard to satisfaction of the rating standard, provided the claim arises under a contract that:
</p>


<p>(1) Is a reverse repurchase/repurchase agreement or securities lending/borrowing transaction executed under standard industry documentation;
</p>
<p>(2) Is collateralized by debt or equity securities that are liquid and readily marketable;
</p>
<p>(3) Is marked-to-market daily;
</p>
<p>(4) Is subject to a daily margin maintenance requirement under the standard industry documentation; and
</p>
<p>(5) Can be liquidated, terminated, or accelerated immediately in bankruptcy or similar proceeding, and the security or collateral agreement will not be stayed or avoided, under applicable law of the relevant jurisdiction.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-47" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-47">47</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>3. <em>Category 3: 50 percent.</em> This category includes loans fully secured by first liens<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-48" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-48">48</a>] </sup>
 on 1- to 4-family residential properties, either owner-occupied or rented, or on multifamily residential properties,<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-49" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-49">49</a>] </sup>
 that meet certain criteria.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-50" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-50">50</a>] </sup>
 Loans included in this category must have been made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards;<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-51" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-51">51</a>] </sup>
 be performing in accordance with their original terms; and not be 90 days or more past due or carried in nonaccrual status. For purposes of this 50 percent risk weight category, a loan modified on a permanent or trial basis solely pursuant to the U.S. Department of Treasury's Home Affordable Mortgage Program will be considered to be performing in accordance with its original terms. The following additional criteria must also be applied to a loan secured by a multifamily residential property that is included in this category: all principal and interest payments on the loan must have been made on time for at least the year preceding placement in this category, or in the case where the existing property owner is refinancing a loan on that property, all principal and interest payments on the loan being refinanced must have been made on time for at least the year preceding placement in this category; amortization of the principal and interest must occur over a period of not more than 30 years and the minimum original maturity for repayment of principal must not be less than 7 years; and the annual net operating income (before debt service) generated by the property during its most recent fiscal year must not be less than 120 percent of the loan's current annual debt service (115 percent if the loan is based on a floating interest rate) or, in the case of a cooperative or other not-for-profit housing project, the property must generate sufficient cash flow to provide comparable protection to the institution. Also included in this category are privately-issued mortgage-backed securities provided that:
</p>




<p>(1) The structure of the security meets the criteria described in section III(B)(3) above;
</p>
<p>(2) if the security is backed by a pool of conventional mortgages, on 1- to 4-family residential or multifamily residential properties, each underlying mortgage meets the criteria described above in this section for eligibility for the 50 percent risk category at the time the pool is originated;
</p>
<p>(3) If the security is backed by privately-issued mortgage-backed securities, each underlying security qualifies for the 50 percent risk category; and
</p>
<p>(4) If the security is backed by a pool of multifamily residential mortgages, principal and interest payments on the security are not 30 days or more past due. Privately-issued mortgage-backed securities that do not meet these criteria or that do not qualify for a lower risk weight are generally assigned to the 100 percent risk category.
</p>
<p>Also assigned to this category are <em>revenue</em> (non-general obligation) bonds or similar obligations, including loans and leases, that are obligations of states or other political subdivisions of the U.S. (for example, municipal revenue bonds) or other countries of the OECD-based group, but for which the government entity is committed to repay the debt with revenues from the specific projects financed, rather than from general tax funds.
</p>
<p>Credit equivalent amounts of derivative contracts involving standard risk obligors (that is, obligors whose loans or debt securities would be assigned to the 100 percent risk category) are included in the 50 percent category, unless they are backed by collateral or guarantees that allow them to be placed in a lower risk category.
</p>
<p>4. <em>Category 4: 100 percent.</em> a. All assets not included in the categories above are assigned to this category, which comprises standard risk assets. The bulk of the assets typically found in a loan portfolio would be assigned to the 100 percent category.
</p>
<p>b. This category includes long-term claims on, and the portions of long-term claims that are guaranteed by, non-OECD banks, and all claims on non-OECD central governments that entail some degree of transfer risk.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-52" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-52">52</a>] </sup>
 This category includes all claims on foreign and domestic private-sector obligors not included in the categories above (including loans to nondepository financial institutions and bank holding companies); claims on commercial firms owned by the public sector; customer liabilities to the organization on acceptances outstanding involving standard risk claims;<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-53" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-53">53</a>] </sup>
 investments in fixed assets, premises, and other real estate owned; common and preferred stock of corporations, including stock acquired for debts previously contracted; all stripped mortgage-backed securities and similar instruments; and commercial and consumer loans (except those assigned to lower risk categories due to recognized guarantees or collateral and loans secured by residential property that qualify for a lower risk weight). This category also includes claims representing capital of a qualifying securities firm.
</p>


<p>c. Also included in this category are industrial-development bonds and similar obligations issued under the auspices of states or political subdivisions of the OECD-based group of countries for the benefit of a private party or enterprise where that party or enterprise, not the government entity, is obligated to pay the principal and interest, and all obligations of states or political subdivisions of countries that do not belong to the OECD-based group.
</p>
<p>d. The following assets also are assigned a risk weight of 100 percent if they have not been deducted from capital: investments in unconsolidated companies, joint ventures, or associated companies; instruments that qualify as capital issued by other banking organizations; and any intangibles, including those that may have been grandfathered into capital.
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">D. Off-Balance Sheet Items
</p>
<p>The face amount of an off-balance sheet item is generally incorporated into risk-weighted assets in two steps. The face amount is first multiplied by a credit conversion factor, except for direct credit substitutes and recourse obligations as discussed in section III.D.1. of this appendix. The resultant credit equivalent amount is assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor or, if relevant, the guarantor, the nature of any collateral, or external credit ratings.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-54" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-54">54</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>1. <em>Items with a 100 percent conversion factor.</em> a. Except as otherwise provided in section III.B.3. of this appendix, the full amount of an asset or transaction supported, in whole or in part, by a direct credit substitute or a recourse obligation. Direct credit substitutes and recourse obligations are defined in section III.B.3. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>b. Sale and repurchase agreements and forward agreements. Forward agreements are legally binding contractual obligations to purchase assets with certain drawdown at a specified future date. Such obligations include forward purchases, forward forward deposits placed,<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-55" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-55">55</a>] </sup>
 and partly-paid shares and securities; they do not include commitments to make residential mortgage loans or forward foreign exchange contracts.
</p>

<p>c. Securities lent by a banking organization are treated in one of two ways, depending upon whether the lender is at risk of loss. If a banking organization, as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and does not indemnify the customer against loss, then the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capital calculation. If, alternatively, a banking organization lends its own securities or, acting as agent for a customer, lends the customer's securities and indemnifies the customer against loss, the transaction is converted at 100 percent and assigned to the risk weight category appropriate to the obligor, or, if applicable, to any collateral delivered to the lending organization, or the independent custodian acting on the lending organization's behalf. Where a banking organization is acting as agent for a customer in a transaction involving the lending or sale of securities that is collateralized by cash delivered to the banking organization, the transaction is deemed to be collateralized by cash on deposit in a subsidiary depository institution for purposes of determining the appropriate risk-weight category, provided that any indemnification is limited to no more than the difference between the market value of the securities and the cash collateral received and any reinvestment risk associated with that cash collateral is borne by the customer.
</p>
<p>d. In the case of direct credit substitutes in which a risk participation<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-56" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-56">56</a>] </sup>
 has been conveyed, the full amount of the assets that are supported, in whole or in part, by the credit enhancement are converted to a credit equivalent amount at 100 percent. However, the <em>pro rata</em> share of the credit equivalent amount that has been conveyed through a risk participation is assigned to whichever risk category is lower: the risk category appropriate to the obligor, after considering any relevant guarantees or collateral, or the risk category appropriate to the institution acquiring the participation.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-57" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-57">57</a>] </sup>
 Any remainder is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the obligor, guarantor, or collateral. For example, the <em>pro rata</em> share of the full amount of the assets supported, in whole or in part, by a direct credit substitute conveyed as a risk participation to a U.S. domestic depository institution or foreign bank is assigned to the 20 percent risk category.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-58" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-58">58</a>] </sup>

</p>



<p>e. In the case of direct credit substitutes in which a risk participation has been acquired, the acquiring banking organization's percentage share of the direct credit substitute is multiplied by the full amount of the assets that are supported, in whole or in part, by the credit enhancement and converted to a credit equivalent amount at 100 percent. The credit equivalent amount of an acquisition of a risk participation in a direct credit substitute is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the account party obligor or, if relevant, the nature of the collateral or guarantees.
</p>
<p>f. In the case of direct credit substitutes that take the form of a syndication where each banking organization is obligated only for its pro rata share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating banking organization, each banking organization will only include its pro rata share of the assets supported, in whole or in part, by the direct credit substitute in its risk-based capital calculation.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-59" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-59">59</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>2. <em>Items with a 50 percent conversion factor.</em> a. Transaction-related contingencies are converted at 50 percent. Such contingencies include bid bonds, performance bonds, warranties, standby letters of credit related to particular transactions, and performance standby letters of credit, as well as acquisitions of risk participation in performance standby letters of credit. Peformance standby letters of credit represent obligations backing the performance of nonfinancial or commercial contracts or undertakings. To the extent permitted by law or regulation, performance standby letters of credit include arrangements backing, among other things, subcontractors' and suppliers' performance, labor and materials contracts, and construction bids.
</p>
<p>b. The unused portion of commitments with an <em>original</em> maturity exceeding one year, including underwriting commitments, and commercial and consumer credit commitments also are converted at 50 percent. Original maturity is defined as the length of time between the date the commitment is issued and the earliest date on which: (1) The banking organization can, at its option, unconditionally (without cause) cancel the commitment;<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-60" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-60">60</a>] </sup>
 and (2) the banking organization is scheduled to (and as a normal practice actually does) review the facility to determine whether or not it should be extended. Such reviews must continue to be conducted at least annually for such a facility to qualify as a short-term commitment.
</p>

<p>c.i. Commitments are defined as any legally binding arrangements that obligate a banking organization to extend credit in the form of loans or leases; to purchase loans, securities, or other assets; or to participate in loans and leases. They also include overdraft facilities, revolving credit, home equity and mortgage lines of credit, eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, and similar transactions. Normally, commitments involve a written contract or agreement and a commitment fee, or some other form of consideration. Commitments are included in weighted-risk assets regardless of whether they contain “material adverse change” clauses or other provisions that are intended to relieve the issuer of its funding obligation under certain conditions. In the case of commitments structured as syndications, where the banking organization is obligated solely for its <em>pro rata</em> share, only the organization's proportional share of the syndicated commitment is taken into account in calculating the risk-based capital ratio.
</p>
<p>ii. Banking organizations that are subject to the market risk rules are required to convert the notional amount of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, in form or in substance, with an original maturity of over one year that are carried in the trading account at 50 percent to determine the appropriate credit equivalent amount even though those facilities are structured or characterized as derivatives or other trading book assets. Liquidity facilities that support ABCP, in form or in substance, (including those positions to which the market risk rules may not be applied as set forth in section 2(a) of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-225/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20225" class="cfr external">appendix E of this part</a>) that are not eligible ABCP liquidity facilities are to be considered recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes, and assessed the appropriate risk-based capital treatment in accordance with section III.B.3. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>d. Once a commitment has been converted at 50 percent, any portion that has been conveyed to U.S. depository institutions or OECD banks as participations in which the originating banking organization retains the full obligation to the borrower if the participating bank fails to pay when the instrument is drawn, is assigned to the 20 percent risk category. This treatment is analogous to that accorded to conveyances of risk participations in standby letters of credit. The acquisition of a participation in a commitment by a banking organization is converted at 50 percent and assigned to the risk category appropriate to the account party obligor or, if relevant, the nature of the collateral or guarantees.
</p>
<p>e. Revolving underwriting facilities (RUFs), note issuance facilities (NIFs), and other similar arrangements also are converted at 50 percent regardless of maturity. These are facilities under which a borrower can issue on a revolving basis short-term paper in its own name, but for which the underwriting organizations have a legally binding commitment either to purchase any notes the borrower is unable to sell by the roll-over date or to advance funds to the borrower.
</p>
<p>3. <em>Items with a 20 percent conversion factor.</em> Short-term, self-liquidating trade-related contingencies which arise from the movement of goods are converted at 20 percent. Such contingencies generally include commercial letters of credit and other documentary letters of credit collateralized by the underlying shipments.
</p>
<p>4. <em>Items with a 10 percent conversion factor.</em> a. Unused portions of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities with an original maturity of one year or less also are converted at 10 percent.
</p>
<p>b. Banking organizations that are subject to the market risk rules are required to convert the notional amount of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities, in form or in substance, with an original maturity of one year or less that are carried in the trading account at 10 percent to determine the appropriate credit equivalent amount even though those facilities are structured or characterized as derivatives or other trading book assets. Liquidity facilities that support ABCP, in form or in substance, (including those positions to which the market risk rules may not be applied as set forth in section 2(a) of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-225/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20225" class="cfr external">appendix E of this part</a>) that are not eligible ABCP liquidity facilities are to be considered recourse obligations or direct credit substitutes and assessed the appropriate risk-based capital requirement in accordance with section III.B.3. of this appendix.
</p>
<p>5. <em>Items with a zero percent conversion factor.</em> These include unused portions of commitments (with the exception of eligible ABCP liquidity facilities) with an original maturity of one year or less, or which are unconditionally cancelable at any time, provided a separate credit decision is made before each drawing under the facility. Unused portions of lines of credit on retail credit cards and related plans are deemed to be short-term commitments if the banking organization has the unconditional right to cancel the line of credit at any time, in accordance with applicable law.
</p>
<p><em>E. Derivative Contracts (Interest Rate, Exchange Rate, Commodity- (including precious metals) and Equity-Linked Contracts)</em>
</p>
<p>1. <em>Scope.</em> Credit equivalent amounts are computed for each of the following off-balance-sheet derivative contracts:
</p>
<p>a. Interest Rate Contracts. These include single currency interest rate swaps, basis swaps, forward rate agreements, interest rate options purchased (including caps, collars, and floors purchased), and any other instrument linked to interest rates that gives rise to similar credit risks (including when-issued securities and forward forward deposits accepted).
</p>
<p>b. Exchange Rate Contracts. These include cross-currency interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options purchased, and any other instrument linked to exchange rates that gives rise to similar credit risks.
</p>
<p>c. Equity Derivative Contracts. These include equity-linked swaps, equity-linked options purchased, forward equity-linked contracts, and any other instrument linked to equities that gives rise to similar credit risks.
</p>
<p>d. Commodity (including precious metal) Derivative Contracts. These include commodity-linked swaps, commodity-linked options purchased, forward commodity-linked contracts, and any other instrument linked to commodities that gives rise to similar credit risks.
</p>
<p>e. Exceptions. Exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen or fewer calendar days and derivative contracts traded on exchanges that require daily receipt and payment of cash variation margin may be excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation. Gold contracts are accorded the same treatment as exchange rate contracts except that gold contracts with an original maturity of fourteen or fewer calendar days are included in the risk-based ratio calculation. Over-the-counter options purchased are included and treated in the same way as other derivative contracts.
</p>
<p>2. <em>Calculation of credit equivalent amounts.</em> a. The credit equivalent amount of a derivative contract that is not subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract in accordance with section III.E.3. of this appendix A is equal to the sum of (i) the current exposure (sometimes referred to as the replacement cost) of the contract; and (ii) an estimate of the potential future credit exposure of the contract.
</p>
<p>b. The current exposure is determined by the mark-to-market value of the contract. If the mark-to-market value is positive, then the current exposure is equal to that mark-to-market value. If the mark-to-market value is zero or negative, then the current exposure is zero. Mark-to-market values are measured in dollars, regardless of the currency or currencies specified in the contract and should reflect changes in underlying rates, prices, and indices, as well as counterparty credit quality.
</p>
<p>c. The potential future credit exposure of a contract, including a contract with a negative mark-to-market value, is estimated by multiplying the notional principal amount of the contract by a credit conversion factor. Banking organizations should use, subject to examiner review, the effective rather than the apparent or stated notional amount in this calculation. The credit conversion factors are:
</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><div class="table-header"><p class="table-title">Conversion Factors
</p><p class="table-description">[In percent]
</p></div><table><thead><tr><th>Remaining maturity
</th><th>Interest rate
</th><th>Exchange rate and gold
</th><th>Equity
</th><th>Commodity, excluding precious metals
</th><th>Precious metals, except gold
</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td class="align-left">One year or less</td><td class="align-right">0.0</td><td class="align-right">1.0</td><td class="align-right">6.0</td><td class="align-right">10.0</td><td class="align-right">7.0
</td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Over one to five years</td><td class="align-right">0.5</td><td class="align-right">5.0</td><td class="align-right">8.0</td><td class="align-right">12.0</td><td class="align-right">7.0
</td></tr><tr><td class="align-left">Over five years</td><td class="align-right">1.5</td><td class="align-right">7.5</td><td class="align-right">10.0</td><td class="align-right">15.0</td><td class="align-right">8.0</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
<p>d. For a contract that is structured such that on specified dates any outstanding exposure is settled and the terms are reset so that the market value of the contract is zero, the remaining maturity is equal to the time until the next reset date. For an interest rate contract with a remaining maturity of more than one year that meets these criteria, the minimum conversion factor is 0.5 percent.
</p>
<p>e. For a contract with multiple exchanges of principal, the conversion factor is multiplied by the number of remaining payments in the contract. A derivative contract not included in the definitions of interest rate, exchange rate, equity, or commodity contracts as set forth in section III.<em>E.</em>1. of this appendix A is subject to the same conversion factors as a commodity, excluding precious metals.
</p>
<p>f. No potential future exposure is calculated for a single currency interest rate swap in which payments are made based upon two floating rate indices (a so called floating/floating or basis swap); the credit exposure on such a contract is evaluated solely on the basis of the mark-to-market value.
</p>
<p>g. The Board notes that the conversion factors set forth above, which are based on observed volatilities of the particular types of instruments, are subject to review and modification in light of changing volatilities or market conditions.
</p>
<p>3. <em>Netting.</em> a. For purposes of this appendix A, netting refers to the offsetting of positive and negative mark-to-market values when determining a current exposure to be used in the calculation of a credit equivalent amount. Any legally enforceable form of bilateral netting (that is, netting with a single counterparty) of derivative contracts is recognized for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount provided that:
</p>
<p>i. The netting is accomplished under a written netting contract that creates a single legal obligation, covering all included individual contracts, with the effect that the banking organization would have a claim to receive, or obligation to pay, only the net amount of the sum of the positive and negative mark-to-market values on included individual contracts in the event that a counterparty, or a counterparty to whom the contract has been validly assigned, fails to perform due to any of the following events: default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances.
</p>
<p>ii. The banking organization obtains a written and reasoned legal opinion(s) representing that in the event of a legal challenge—including one resulting from default, insolvency, liquidation, or similar circumstances—the relevant court and administrative authorities would find the banking organization's exposure to be the net amount under:
</p>
<p><em>1.</em> The law of the jurisdiction in which the counterparty is chartered or the equivalent location in the case of noncorporate entities, and if a branch of the counterparty is involved, then also under the law of the jurisdiction in which the branch is located;
</p>
<p><em>2.</em> The law that governs the individual contracts covered by the netting contract; and
</p>
<p><em>3.</em> The law that governs the netting contract.
</p>
<p>iii. The banking organization establishes and maintains procedures to ensure that the legal characteristics of netting contracts are kept under review in the light of possible changes in relevant law.
</p>
<p>iv. The banking organization maintains in its files documentation adequate to support the netting of derivative contracts, including a copy of the bilateral netting contract and necessary legal opinions.
</p>
<p>b. A contract containing a walkaway clause is not eligible for netting for purposes of calculating the credit equivalent amount.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-61" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-61">61</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>c. A banking organization netting individual contracts for the purpose of calculating credit equivalent amounts of derivative contracts represents that it has met the requirements of this appendix A and all the appropriate documents are in the banking organization's files and available for inspection by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve may determine that a banking organization's files are inadequate or that a netting contract, or any of its underlying individual contracts, may not be legally enforceable under any one of the bodies of law described in section III.<em>E.</em>3.a.ii. of this appendix A. If such a determination is made, the netting contract may be disqualified from recognition for risk-based capital purposes or underlying individual contracts may be treated as though they are not subject to the netting contract.
</p>
<p>d. The credit equivalent amount of contracts that are subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract is calculated by adding (i) the current exposure of the netting contract (net current exposure) and (ii) the sum of the estimates of potential future credit exposures on all individual contracts subject to the netting contract (gross potential future exposure) adjusted to reflect the effects of the netting contract.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-62" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-62">62</a>] </sup>

</p>

<p>e. The net current exposure is the sum of all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual contracts included in the netting contract. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is positive, then the net current exposure is equal to that sum. If the net sum of the mark-to-market values is zero or negative, then the net current exposure is zero. The Federal Reserve may determine that a netting contract qualifies for risk-based capital netting treatment even though certain individual contracts included under the netting contract may not qualify. In such instances, the nonqualifying contracts should be treated as individual contracts that are not subject to the netting contract.
</p>
<p>f. Gross potential future exposure, or A<sub>gross</sub> is calculated by summing the estimates of potential future exposure (determined in accordance with section III.<em>E.</em>2 of this appendix A) for each individual contract subject to the qualifying bilateral netting contract.
</p>
<p>g. The effects of the bilateral netting contract on the gross potential future exposure are recognized through the application of a formula that results in an adjusted add-on amount (A<sub>net</sub>). The formula, which employs the ratio of net current exposure to gross current exposure (NGR), is expressed as:
</p>
<p class="flush-paragraph-2">A<sub>net</sub> = (0.4 × A<sub>gross</sub>) + 0.6(NGR × A<sub>gross</sub>)
</p>
<p>h. The NGR may be calculated in accordance with either the counterparty-by-counterparty approach or the aggregate approach.
</p>
<p>i. Under the counterparty-by-counterparty approach, the NGR is the ratio of the net current exposure for a netting contract to the gross current exposure of the netting contract. The gross current exposure is the sum of the current exposures of all individual contracts subject to the netting contract calculated in accordance with section III.<em>E.</em>2. of this appendix A. Net negative mark-to-market values for individual netting contracts with the same counterparty may not be used to offset net positive mark-to-market values for other netting contracts with the same counterparty.
</p>
<p>ii. Under the aggregate approach, the NGR is the ratio of the sum of all of the net current exposures for qualifying bilateral netting contracts to the sum of all of the gross current exposures for those netting contracts (each gross current exposure is calculated in the same manner as in section III.<em>E.</em>3.h.i. of this appendix A). Net negative mark-to-market values for individual counterparties may not be used to offset net positive current exposures for other counterparties.
</p>
<p>iii. A banking organization must use consistently either the counterparty-by-counterparty approach or the aggregate approach to calculate the NGR. Regardless of the approach used, the NGR should be applied individually to each qualifying bilateral netting contract to determine the adjusted add-on for that netting contract.
</p>
<p>i. In the event a netting contract covers contracts that are normally excluded from the risk-based ratio calculation—for example, exchange rate contracts with an original maturity of fourteen or fewer calendar days or instruments traded on exchanges that require daily payment and receipt of cash variation margin—an institution may elect to either include or exclude all mark-to-market values of such contracts when determining net current exposure, provided the method chosen is applied consistently.
</p>
<p>4. <em>Risk Weights.</em> Once the credit equivalent amount for a derivative contract, or a group of derivative contracts subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract, has been determined, that amount is assigned to the risk category appropriate to the counterparty, or, if relevant, the guarantor or the nature of any collateral.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-63" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-63">63</a>] </sup>
 However, the maximum risk weight applicable to the credit equivalent amount of such contracts is 50 percent.
</p>

<p>5. <em>Avoidance of double counting.</em> a. In certain cases, credit exposures arising from the derivative contracts covered by section III.<em>E.</em> of this appendix A may already be reflected, in part, on the balance sheet. To avoid double counting such exposures in the assessment of capital adequacy and, perhaps, assigning inappropriate risk weights, counterparty credit exposures arising from the derivative instruments covered by these guidelines may need to be excluded from balance sheet assets in calculating a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios.
</p>
<p>b. Examples of the calculation of credit equivalent amounts for contracts covered under this section III.<em>E.</em> are contained in Attachment V of this appendix A.
</p>
<p class="hd1-paragraph">IV. Minimum Supervisory Ratios and Standards
</p>
<p>The interim and final supervisory standards set forth below specify <em>minimum</em> supervisory ratios based primarily on broad credit risk considerations. As noted above, the risk-based ratio does not take explicit account of the quality of individual asset portfolios or the range of other types of risks to which banking organizations may be exposed, such as interest rate, liquidity, market or operational risks. For this reason, banking organizations are generally expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios.
</p>
<p>Institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk are expected to operate well above minimum capital standards. Banking organizations experiencing or anticipating significant growth are also expected to maintain capital, including tangible capital positions, well above the minimum levels. For example, most such organizations generally have operated at capital levels ranging from 100 to 200 basis points above the stated minimums. Higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations. In all cases, organizations should hold capital commensurate with the level and nature of all of the risks, including the volume and severity of problem loans, to which they are exposed.
</p>
<p>Upon adoption of the risk-based framework, any organization that does not meet the interim or final supervisory ratios, or whose capital is otherwise considered inadequate, is expected to develop and implement a plan acceptable to the Federal Reserve for achieving an adequate level of capital consistent with the provisions of these guidelines or with the special circumstances affecting the individual organization. In addition, such organizations should avoid any actions, including increased risk-taking or unwarranted expansion, that would lower or further erode their capital positions.
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">A. Minimum Risk-Based Ratio After Transition Period
</p>
<p>As reflected in Attachment VI, by year-end 1992, all bank holding companies<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footnote-64" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-225-footref-64">64</a>] </sup>
 should meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of 8 percent, of which at least 4.0 percentage points should be in the form of Tier 1 capital. For purposes of section IV.A., Tier 1 capital is defined as the sum of core capital elements less goodwill and other intangible assets required to be deducted in accordance with section II.B.1.b. of this appendix. The maximum amount of supplementary capital elements that qualifies as Tier 2 capital is limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital. In addition, the combined maximum amount of subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock that qualifies as Tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of Tier 1 capital. The maximum amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that qualifies as Tier 2 capital is limited to 1.25 percent of gross weighted risk assets. Allowances for loan and lease losses in excess of this limit may, of course, be maintained, but would not be included in an organization's total capital. The Federal Reserve will continue to require bank holding companies to maintain reserves at levels fully sufficient to cover losses inherent in their loan portfolios.
</p>

<p>Qualifying total capital is calculated by adding Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital (limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital) and then deducting from this sum certain investments in banking or finance subsidiaries that are not consolidated for accounting or supervisory purposes, reciprocal holdings of banking organizations' capital securities, or other items at the direction of the Federal Reserve. The conditions under which these deductions are to be made and the procedures for making the deductions are discussed above in section II(B).
</p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">B. Transition Arrangements
</p>
<p>The transition period for implementing the risk-based capital standard ends on December 31, 1992. Initially, the risk-based capital guidelines do not establish a minimum level of capital. However, by year-end 1990, banking organizations are expected to meet a minimum interim target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of 7.25 percent, at least one-half of which should be in the form of Tier 1 capital. For purposes of meeting the 1990 interim target, the amount of loan loss reserves that may be included in capital is limited to 1.5 percent of weighted risk assets and up to 10 percent of an organization's Tier 1 capital may consist of supplementary capital elements. Thus, the 7.25 percent interim target ratio implies a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to weighted risk assets of 3.6 percent (one-half of 7.25) and a minimum ratio of core capital elements to weighted risk assets ratio of 3.25 percent (nine-tenths of the Tier 1 capital ratio).
</p>
<p>Through year-end 1990, banking organizations have the option of complying with the minimum 7.25 percent year-end 1990 risk-based capital standard, in lieu of the minimum 5.5 percent primary and 6 percent total capital to total assets ratios set forth in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-225/appendix-Appendix%20B%20to%20Part%20225" class="cfr external">appendix B of this part</a>. In addition, as more fully set forth in appendix D to this part, banking organizations are expected to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to total assets during this transition period.

<p class="hd2-paragraph">C. Optional Transition Provisions Related to the Implementation of Consolidation Requirements under FAS 167
</p>
<p>This section IV.C. provides optional transition provisions for a banking organization that is required for financial and regulatory reporting purposes, as a result of its implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 167, <em>Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)</em> (FAS 167), to consolidate certain variable interest entities (VIEs) as defined under United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These transition provisions apply through the end of the fourth quarter following the date of a banking organization's implementation of FAS 167 (implementation date).
</p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">1. Exclusion Period
</p>
<p>a. <em>Exclusion of risk-weighted assets for the first and second quarters.</em> For the first two quarters after the implementation date (exclusion period), including for the two calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates within those quarters, a banking organization may exclude from risk-weighted assets:
</p>
<p>i. Subject to the limitations in section IV.C.3, assets held by a VIE, provided that the following conditions are met:
</p>
<p>(<em>1</em>) The VIE existed prior to the implementation date,
</p>
<p>(<em>2</em>) The banking organization did not consolidate the VIE on its balance sheet for calendar quarter-end regulatory report dates prior to the implementation date,
</p>

An organization may, at its option, assign a fund investment on a pro rata basis to different risk categories according to the investment limits in the fund's prospectus. In no case will an investment in shares in any fund be assigned to a total risk weight of less than 20 percent. If an organization chooses to assign a fund investment on a pro rata basis, and the sum of the investment limits of assets in the fund's prospectus exceeds 100 percent, the organization must assign risk weights in descending order. If, in order to maintain a necessary degree of short-term liquidity, a fund is permitted to hold an insignificant amount of its assets in short-term, highly liquid securities of superior credit quality that do not qualify for a preferential risk weight, such securities generally will be disregarded when determining the risk category into which the organization's holding in the overall fund should be assigned. The prudent use of hedging instruments by a fund to reduce the risk of its assets will not increase the risk weighting of the fund investment. For example, the use of hedging instruments by a fund to reduce the interest rate risk of its government bond portfolio will not increase the risk weight of that fund above the 20 percent category.

</h4>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Policy Statement on Assessment of Financial and Managerial Factors </p>
<p>In acting on applications filed under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Board has adopted, and continues to follow, the principle that bank holding companies should serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks. When bank holding companies incur debt and rely upon the earnings of their subsidiary banks as the means of repaying such debt, a question arises as to the probable effect upon the financial condition of the holding company and its subsidiary bank or banks. </p>
<p>The Board believes that a high level of debt at the parent holding company impairs the ability of a bank holding company to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary bank(s) and, in some cases, the servicing requirements on such debt may be a significant drain on the resources of the bank(s). For these reasons, the Board has not favored the use of acquisition debt in the formation of bank holding companies or in the acquisition of additional banks. Nevertheless, the Board has recognized that the transfer of ownership of small banks often requires the use of acquisition debt. The Board, therefore, has permitted the formation and expansion of small bank holding companies with debt levels higher than would be permitted for larger holding companies. Approval of these applications has been given on the condition that small bank holding companies demonstrate the ability to service acquisition debt without straining the capital of their subsidiary banks and, further, that such companies restore their ability to serve as a source of strength for their subsidiary banks within a relatively short period of time. </p>
<p>In the interest of continuing its policy of facilitating the transfer of ownership in banks without compromising bank safety and soundness, the Board has, as described below, adopted the following procedures and standards for the formation and expansion of small bank holding companies subject to this policy statement. </p>

The Board may in its discretion exclude any bank holding company, regardless of asset size, from the policy statement if such action is warranted for supervisory purposes.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-C-to-Part-225-footnote-1" id="Appendix-C-to-Part-225-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  With the exception of section 4 (Additional Application Requirements for Expedited/Waived Processing), the policy statement applies to savings and loan holding companies as if they were bank holding companies. </p>

<p><sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-C-to-Part-225-footref-3">3</a>]</sup> The term <em>debt,</em> as used in the ratio of debt to equity, means any borrowed funds (exclusive of short-term borrowings that arise out of current transactions, the proceeds of which are used for current transactions), and any securities issued by, or obligations of, the holding company that are the functional equivalent of borrowed funds.
</p>
<p>Subordinated debt associated with trust preferred securities generally would be treated as debt for purposes of paragraphs 2.C., 3.A., 4.A.i., and 4.B.i. of this policy statement. A bank holding company, however, may exclude from debt an amount of subordinated debt associated with trust preferred securities up to 25 percent of the holding company's equity (as defined below) less goodwill on the parent company's balance sheet in determining compliance with the requirements of such paragraphs of the policy statement. In addition, a bank holding company subject to this policy statement that has not issued subordinated debt associated with a new issuance of trust preferred securities after December 31, 2005, may exclude from debt any subordinated debt associated with trust preferred securities until December 31, 2010. Bank holding companies subject to this policy statement also may exclude from debt until December 31, 2010, any subordinated debt associated with refinanced issuances of trust preferred securities originally issued on or prior to December 31, 2005, provided that the refinancing does not increase the bank holding company's outstanding amount of subordinated debt. Subordinated debt associated with trust preferred securities will not be included as debt in determining compliance with any other requirements of this policy statement.
</p>
<p>In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this policy statement and for purposes of compliance with paragraphs 2.C., 3.A., 4.A.i, and 4.B.i. of this policy statement, both a bank holding company that is organized in mutual form and a bank holding company that has made a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code may exclude from debt subordinated debentures issued to the United States Department of the Treasury under (i) the Troubled Asset Relief Program established by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, Division A of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/110/public/343" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 110–343</a>, 122 Stat. 3765 (2008), and (ii) the Small Business Lending Fund established by the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, title IV of <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/plaw/111/public/240" class="publ external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Public Law 111–240</a>, 124 Stat. 2504 (2010).
</p>
<p>The term <em>equity,</em> as used in the ratio of debt to equity, means the total stockholders' equity of the bank holding company as defined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. In determining the total amount of stockholders' equity, the bank holding company should account for its investments in the common stock of subsidiaries by the equity method of accounting.
</p>
<p>Ordinarily the Board does not view redeemable preferred stock as a substitute for common stock in a small bank holding company. Nevertheless, to a limited degree and under certain circumstances, the Board will consider redeemable preferred stock as equity in the capital accounts of the holding company if the following conditions are met: (1) The preferred stock is redeemable only at the option of the issuer; and (2) the debt to equity ratio of the holding company would be at or remain below .30:1 following the redemption or retirement of any preferred stock. Preferred stock that is convertible into common stock of the holding company may be treated as equity. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Financial institutions have an affirmative duty to protect their customers' information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying customers of a security incident involving the unauthorized access or use of the customer's information in accordance with the standard set forth below is a key part of that duty. Timely notification of customers is important to manage an institution's reputation risk. Effective notice also may reduce an institution's legal risk, assist in maintaining good customer relations, and enable the institution's customers to take steps to protect themselves against the consequences of identity theft. When customer notification is warranted, an institution may not forgo notifying its customers of an incident because the institution believes that it may be potentially embarrassed or inconvenienced by doing so. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-F-to-Part-225(III.)(A.)" data-title="Appendix-F-to-Part-225 III.A.">A. Standard for Providing Notice </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">When a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution should conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines that misuse of its information about a customer has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should notify the affected customer as soon as possible. Customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for the delay. However, the institution should notify its customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere with the investigation. </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Under the Guidelines, an institution must protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Substantial harm or inconvenience is most likely to result from improper access to <em>sensitive customer information</em> because this type of information is most likely to be misused, as in the commission of identity theft. For purposes of this Guidance, <em>sensitive customer information</em> means a customer's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the customer's social security number, driver's license number, account number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the customer's account. <em>Sensitive customer information</em> also includes any combination of components of customer information that would allow someone to log onto or access the customer's account, such as user name and password or password and account number. </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">If a financial institution, based upon its investigation, can determine from its logs or other data precisely which customers' information has been improperly accessed, it may limit notification to those customers with regard to whom the institution determines that misuse of their information has occurred or is reasonably possible. However, there may be situations where the institution determines that a group of files has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify which specific customers' information has been accessed. If the circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the institution to determine that misuse of the information is reasonably possible, it should notify all customers in the group. </p>
