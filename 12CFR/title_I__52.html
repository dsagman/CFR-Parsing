<p>The OCC may determine that a covered depository institution shall not use the reduced reporting in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-52.3" class="cfr external">§ 52.3</a>. In making this determination, the OCC will consider whether the institution is significantly engaged in complex, specialized, or higher risk activities, for which a reduced reporting requirement would not provide sufficient information. The institution has 30 days following notification from the OCC to inform the OCC, in writing, of why it should continue to be eligible to use reduced reporting or cannot cease using reduced reporting in the OCC's proposed timeframe. The OCC will make a final decision after reviewing any response. Nothing in this part shall be construed to limit the OCC's authority to obtain information from a covered depository institution. </p>
