<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-741" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-741">I. Introduction </p>
<p>This appendix provides guidance to FICUs in developing an interest rate risk (IRR) policy and program that addresses aspects of asset liability management in a single framework. An effective IRR management program identifies, measures, monitors, and controls IRR and is central to safe and sound credit union operations. Given the differences among credit unions, each credit union should use the guidance in this appendix to formulate a policy that embodies its own practices, metrics and benchmarks appropriate to its operations. </p>
<p>These practices should be established in light of the nature of the credit union's operations and business, as well as its complexity, risk exposure, and size. As these elements increase, NCUA believes the IRR practices should be implemented with increasing degrees of rigor and diligence to maintain safe and sound operations in the area of IRR management. In particular, rigor and diligence are required to manage complexity and risk exposure. Complexity relates to the intricacy of financial instrument structure, and to the composition of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet. In the case of financial instruments, the structure can have numerous characteristics that act simultaneously to affect the behavior of the instrument. In the case of the balance sheet, which contains multiple instruments, assets and liabilities can act in ways that are compounding or can be offsetting because their impact on the IRR level may act in the same or opposite directions. High degrees of risk exposure require a credit union to be diligently aware of the potential earnings and net worth exposures under various interest rate and business environments because the margin for error is low. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">A. Complexity </p>
<p>In influencing the behavior of instruments and balance sheet composition, complexity is a function of the predictability of the cash flows. As cash flows become less predictable, the uncertainty of both instrument and balance sheet behavior increases. For example, a residential mortgage is subject to prepayments that will change at the option of the borrower. Mortgage borrowers may pay off their mortgage loans due to geographical relocation, or may increase the amount of their monthly payment above the minimum contractual schedule due to other changes in the borrower's circumstances. This cash flow unpredictability is also found in investments, such as collateralized mortgage obligations, because these contain mortgage loans. Additionally, cash flow unpredictability affects liabilities. For example, nonmaturity share balances vary at the discretion of the depositor making deposits and withdrawals, and this may be influenced by a credit union's pricing of its share accounts. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">B. IRR Exposure </p>
<p>Exposure to IRR is the vulnerability of a credit union's financial condition to adverse movements in market interest rates. Although some IRR exposure is a normal part of financial intermediation, a high degree of this exposure may negatively affect a credit union's earnings and net economic value. Changes in interest rates influence a credit union's earnings by altering interest-sensitive income and expenses (<em>e.g.</em> loan income and share dividends). Changes in interest rates also affect the economic value of a credit union's assets and liabilities, because the present value of future cash flows and, in some cases, the cash flows themselves may change when interest rates change. Consequently, the management of a credit union's pricing strategy is critical to the control of IRR exposure. </p>
<p>All FICUs required to have an IRR policy and program should incorporate the following five elements into their IRR program: </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The board of directors is responsible for ensuring the adequacy of an IRR policy and its limits. The policy should be consistent with the credit union's business strategies and should reflect the board's risk tolerance, taking into account the credit union's financial condition and risk measurement systems and methods commensurate with the balance sheet structure. The policy should state actions and authorities required for exceptions to policy, limits, and authorizations. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Credit unions have the option of either creating a separate IRR policy or incorporating it into investment, ALM, funds management, liquidity or other policies. Regardless of form, credit unions must clearly document their IRR policy in writing. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The scope of the policy will vary depending on the complexity of the credit union's balance sheet. For example, a credit union that offers short-term loans, invests in non-complex or short-term bullet investments (<em>i.e.</em> a debt security that returns 100 percent of principal on the maturity date), and offers basic share products may not need to create an elaborate policy. The policy for these credit unions may limit the loan portfolio maturity, require a minimum amount of short-term funds, and restrict the types of permissible investments (<em>e.g.</em> Treasuries, bullet investments). More complex balance sheets, especially those containing mortgage loans and complex investments, may warrant a comprehensive IRR policy due to the uncertainty of cash flows. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The policy should establish responsibilities and procedures for identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting IRR, and establish risk limits. A written policy should: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Identify committees, persons or other parties responsible for review of the credit union's IRR exposure; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Direct appropriate actions to ensure management takes steps to manage IRR so that IRR exposures are identified, measured, monitored, and controlled; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• State the frequency with which management will report on measurement results to the board to ensure routine review of information that is timely (<em>e.g.</em> current and at least quarterly) and in sufficient detail to assess the credit union's IRR profile; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Set risk limits for IRR exposures based on selected measures (<em>e.g.</em> limits for changes in repricing or duration gaps, income simulation, asset valuation, or net economic value); </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Choose tests, such as interest rate shocks, that the credit union will perform using the selected measures; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Provide for periodic review of material changes in IRR exposures and compliance with board approved policy and risk limits; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Provide for assessment of the IRR impact of any new business activities prior to implementation (<em>e.g.</em> evaluate the IRR profile of introducing a new product or service); and </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Provide for at least an annual evaluation of policy to determine whether it is still commensurate with the size, complexity, and risk profile of the credit union. </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Generally, credit unions should have IRR measurement systems that capture and measure all material and identified sources of IRR. An IRR measurement system quantifies the risk contained in the credit union's balance sheet and integrates the important sources of IRR faced by a credit union in order to facilitate management of its risk exposures. The selection and assessment of appropriate IRR measurement systems is the responsibility of credit union boards and management. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Management should: </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Document any changes to assumptions based on observed information; </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">• Monitor positions with uncertain maturities, rates and cash flows, such as nonmaturity shares, fixed rate mortgages where prepayments may vary, adjustable rate mortgages, and instruments with embedded options, such as calls; and </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-741(5.)(IV.)(B.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-741(5.)(IV.)(B.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-741 5.IV.B.">B. Risk Measurement Methods </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">The following discussion is intended only as a general guide and should not be used by credit unions as an endorsement of a particular method. An IRR measurement system may rely on a variety of different methods. Common examples of methods available to credit unions are GAP analysis, income simulation, asset valuation, and net economic value. Any measurement method(s) used by a credit union to analyze IRR exposure should correspond with the complexity of the credit union's balance sheet so as to identify any material sources of IRR. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">GAP Analysis </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">GAP analysis is a simple IRR measurement method that reports the mismatch between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over a given time period. GAP can only suffice for simple balance sheets that primarily consist of short-term bullet type investments and non mortgage-related assets. GAP analysis can be static, behavioral, or based on duration. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Income Simulation </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Income simulation is an IRR measurement method used to estimate earnings exposure to changes in interest rates. An income simulation analysis projects interest cash flows of all assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet instruments in a credit union's portfolio to estimate future net interest income over a chosen timeframe. Generally, income simulations focus on short-term time horizons (<em>e.g.</em> one to three years). Forecasting income is assumption sensitive and more uncertain the longer the forecast period. Simulations typically include evaluations under a base-case scenario, and instantaneous parallel rate shocks, and may include alternate interest-rate scenarios. The alternate rate scenarios may involve ramped changes in rates, twisting of the yield curve, and/or stressed rate environments devised by the user or provided by the vendor. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">NCUA Asset Valuation Tables </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">For credit unions lacking advanced IRR methods that seek simple valuation measures, the NCUA Asset Valuation Tables are available and prepared quarterly by the NCUA. These are available on the NCUA Web site through <em><a href="http://www.ncua.gov" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.ncua.gov</a>.</em> </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">These measures provide an indication of a credit union's potential interest rate risk, based on the risk associated with the asset categories of greatest concern—(<em>e.g.,</em> mortgage loans and investment securities). </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">The tables provide a simple measure of the potential devaluation of a credit union's mortgage loans and investment securities that occur during ±300 basis point parallel rate shocks, and report the resulting impact on net worth. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Net Economic Value (NEV) </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">NEV measures the effect of interest rates on the market value of net worth by calculating the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities. This calculation measures the long-term IRR in a credit union's balance sheet at a fixed point in time. By capturing the impact of interest rate changes on the value of all future cash flows, NEV provides a comprehensive measurement of IRR. Generally, NEV computations demonstrate the economic value of net worth under current interest rates and shocked interest rate scenarios. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">One NEV method is to discount cash flows by a single interest rate path. Credit unions with a significant exposure to assets or liabilities with embedded options should consider alternative measurement methods such as discounting along a yield curve (<em>e.g.</em> the U.S. Treasury curve, LIBOR curve) or using multiple interest rate paths. Credit unions should apply and document appropriate methods, based on available data (<em>e.g.</em> utilizing observed market values), when valuing individual or groups of assets and liabilities. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-741(5.)(IV.)(C.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-741(5.)(IV.)(C.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-741 5.IV.C.">C. Components of IRR Measurement Methods </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">In the initial setup of IRR measurement, critical decisions are made regarding numerous variables in the method. These variables include but are not limited to the following. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Chart of Accounts </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Credit unions using an IRR measurement method should define a sufficient number of accounts to capture key IRR characteristics inherent within their product lines. For example, credit unions with significant holdings of adjustable-rate mortgages should differentiate balances by periodic and lifetime caps and floors, the reset frequency, and the rate index used for rate resets. Similarly, credit unions with significant holdings of fixed-rate mortgages should differentiate at least by original term, <em>e.g.,</em> 30 or 15-year, and coupon level to reflect differences in prepayment behaviors. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Aggregation of Data Input </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">As the credit union's complexity, risk exposure, and size increases, the degree of detail should be based on data that is increasingly disaggregated. Because imprecision in the measurement process can materially misstate risk levels, management should evaluate the potential loss of precision from any aggregation and simplification used in its measurement of IRR. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Account Attributes </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Account attributes define a product, including: Principal type, rate type, rate index, repricing interval, new volume maturity distribution, accounting accrual basis, prepayment driver, and discount rate. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Assumptions </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">IRR measurement methods rely on assumptions made by management in order to identify IRR. The simplest example is of future interest rate scenarios. The management of IRR will require other assumptions such as: Projected balance sheet volumes; prepayment rates for loans and investment securities; repricing sensitivity, and decay rates of nonmaturity shares. Examples of these assumptions follow. </p>
<div class="example">
<h1>Example 1.</h1>
<p class="inline-paragraph">Credit unions should consider evaluating the balance sheet under flat (<em>i.e.</em> static) and/or planned growth scenarios to capture IRR exposures. Under a flat scenario, runoff amounts are reinvested in their respective asset or liability account. Conducting planned growth scenarios allows management to assess the IRR impact of the projected change in volume and/or composition of the balance sheet.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<h1>Example 2.</h1>
<p class="inline-paragraph">Loans and mortgage related securities contain prepayment options that enable the borrower to prepay the obligation prior to maturity. This prepayment option makes it difficult to project the value and earnings stream from these assets because the future outstanding principal balance at any given time is unknown. A number of factors affect prepayments, including the refinancing incentive, seasonality (the particular time of year), seasoning (the age of the loan), member mobility, curtailments (additional principal payments), and burnout (borrowers who don't respond to changes in the level of rates, and pay as scheduled). Prepayment speeds may be estimated or derived from numerous national or vendor data sources.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<h1>Example 3.</h1>
<p class="inline-paragraph">In the process of IRR measurement, the credit union must estimate how each account will reprice in response to market rate fluctuations. For example, when rates rise 300 basis points, the credit union may raise its asset or liability rates in a like amount or not, and may choose to lag the timing of its pricing change.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
<h1>Example 4.</h1>
<p class="inline-paragraph">Nonmaturity shares include those accounts with no defined maturity such as share drafts, regular shares, and money market accounts. Measuring the IRR associated with these accounts is difficult because the risk measurement calculations require the user to define the principal cash flows and maturity. Credit unions may assume that there is no value when measuring the associated IRR and carry these values at book value or par. Many credit unions adopt this approach because it keeps the measurement method simple.</p>
</div>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Alternatively, a credit union may attribute value to these shares (<em>i.e.</em> premium) on the basis that these shares tend to be lower cost funds that are core balances by virtue of being relatively insensitive to interest rates. This method generally results in nonmaturity shares priced/valued in a way that will produce an increased net economic value. Therefore, the underlying assumptions of the shares require scrutiny. </p>
<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Credit unions that forecast share behavior and incorporate those assumptions into their risk identification and measurement process should perform sensitivity analysis. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-741(5.)(V.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-741 5.V.">V. Internal Controls </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Internal controls are an essential part of a safe and sound IRR program. If possible, separation of those responsible for the risk taking and risk measuring functions should occur at the credit union. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Staff responsible for maintaining controls should periodically assess the overall IRR program as well as compliance with policy. Internal audit staff would normally assume this role; however, if there is no internal auditor, management, or a supervisory committee that is independent of the IRR process, may perform this role. Where appropriate, management may also supplement the internal audit with outside expertise to assess the IRR program. This review should include policy compliance, timeliness, and accuracy of reports given to management and the board. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Audit findings should be reported to the board or supervisory committee with recommended corrective actions and timeframes. The individuals responsible for maintaining internal controls should periodically examine adherence to the policy related to the IRR program. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Management should utilize the results of the credit union's IRR measurement systems in making operational decisions such as changing balance sheet structure, funding, pricing strategies, and business planning. This is particularly the case when measures show a high level of IRR or when measurement results approach board-approved limits. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">NCUA recognizes each credit union has its own individual risk profile and tolerance levels. However, when measures of fair value indicate net worth is low, declining, or even negative, or income simulations indicate reduced earnings, management should be prepared to identify steps, if necessary, to bring risk within acceptable levels. In any case, management should understand and use their IRR measurement results, whether generated internally or externally, in the normal course of business. Management should also use the results proactively as a tool to adjust asset liability management for changes in interest rate environments. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">NCUA acknowledges both the range of IRR exposures at credit unions, and the diverse means that they may use to accomplish an effective program to manage this risk. NCUA therefore does not stipulate specific quantitative standards or limits for the management of IRR applicable to all credit unions, and does not rely solely on the results of quantitative approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of IRR programs. Assumptions, measures and methods used by a credit union in light of its size, complexity and risk exposure determine the specific appropriate standard. However, NCUA strongly affirms the need for adequate practices for a program to effectively manage IRR. For example, policy limits on IRR exposure are not adequate if they allow a credit union to operate with an exposure that is unsafe or unsound, which means that the credit union may suffer material losses under plausible adverse circumstances as a result of this exposure. Credit unions that do not have a written IRR policy or that do not have an effective IRR program are out of compliance with <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-741.3" class="cfr external">§ 741.3</a> of NCUA's regulations. </p>

For purposes of data collection, NCUA also uses $500 million and above as its largest credit union asset range. In order to gather information and to monitor IRR exposure at larger credit unions as it relates to the share insurance fund, NCUA will use this as the criterion for definition of large credit unions for purposes of this section of the guidance. Given the increased exposure to the share insurance fund, NCUA encourages the responsible officials at large credit unions that are complex or high risk to fully understand all aspects of interest rate risk, including but not limited to the credit union's IRR assessment and potential directional changes in IRR exposures. For example, the credit union should consider the following: </p>

</h4>
<p>This Appendix establishes requirements for the management of loan <em>workout</em><sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-1" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  arrangements, loan nonaccrual, and regulatory reporting of <em>troubled debt restructured loans</em> (herein after referred to as TDR or TDRs). This Appendix applies to all federally insured credit unions. </p>

<p>Under this Appendix, TDRs are as defined in <em>generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP),</em> and the Board does not intend to change the Financial Accounting Standards Board's (FASB) definition of TDR in any way through this policy. In addition to existing agency policy, this Appendix sets the NCUA's supervisory expectations governing loan workout policies and practices and loan accruals. </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-741">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-741" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-741">Written Loan Workout Policy and Monitoring Requirements<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-2" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p>For purposes of this Appendix, types of workout loans to borrowers in financial difficulties include <em>re-agings, extensions, deferrals, renewals, or rewrites.</em> See the Glossary entry on workouts for further descriptions of each term. Borrower retention programs or <em>new loans</em> are not encompassed within this policy nor considered by the Board to be workout loans. </p>
<p>A credit union can use loan workouts to help borrowers overcome temporary financial difficulties such as loss of job, medical emergency, or change in family circumstances such as the loss of a family member. Loan workout arrangements must consider and balance the best interests of both the borrower and the credit union. </p>
<p>The lack of a sound written policy on workouts can mask the true performance and <em>past due</em> status of the loan portfolio. Accordingly, the credit union board and management must adopt and adhere to an explicit written policy and standards that control the use of loan workouts, and establish controls to ensure the policy is consistently applied. The loan workout policy and practices should be commensurate with a credit union's size and complexity, and must conform with a credit union's broader risk mitigation strategies. The policy must define eligibility requirements (that is, under what conditions the credit union will consider a loan workout), including establishing limits on the number of times an individual loan may be modified.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-3" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>  The policy must also ensure credit unions make loan workout decisions based on a borrower's renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan. If a credit union restructures a loan more frequently than once a year or twice in five years, examiners will have higher expectations for the documentation of the borrower's renewed willingness and ability to repay the loan. The NCUA is concerned about restructuring activity that pushes existing losses into future reporting periods without improving a loan's collectability. One way a credit union can provide convincing evidence that multiple restructurings improve collectability is to validate completed multiple restructurings that substantiate the claim. Examiners will ask for such validation documentation if a credit union engages in multiple restructurings of a loan. </p>

<p>In addition, the policy must establish sound controls to ensure loan workout actions are appropriately structured.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-4" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-4">4</a>] </sup>  The policy must explicitly prohibit the authorization of additional advances to finance credit union fees and commissions. The credit union may, however, make advances to cover third-party fees, such as force-placed insurance or property taxes. For loan workouts granted, a credit union must document the determination that the borrower is willing and able to repay the loan. </p>

<p>Modifications of loans that result in capitalization of unpaid interest are appropriate only when a borrower has the ability to repay the debt. At a minimum, if a FICU's loan modification policy permits capitalization of unpaid interest, the policy must require: </p>

Sound management information systems identify and document any loan that is re-aged, extended, deferred, renewed, or rewritten, including the frequency and extent of such action. Documentation normally shows that credit union personnel communicated with the borrower, the borrower agreed to pay the loan in full under any new terms, and the borrower has the ability to repay the loan under any new terms. </p>

<p>Credit unions must recognize interest income appropriately. Credit unions must place loans in nonaccrual status when doubt exists as to full collection of principal and interest or the loan has been in default for a period of 90 days or more. Upon placing a loan in nonaccrual, a credit union must reverse or charge-off previously accrued but uncollected interest. A nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when a credit union expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest or it is well secured and in process of collection.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-7" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-7">7</a>] </sup>  This policy on loan accrual is consistent with longstanding credit union industry practice as implemented by the NCUA over the last several decades. The balance of the policy relates to <em>commercial</em> and <em>member business loan</em> workouts and is similar to the policies adopted by the federal banking agencies<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-8" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-8">8</a>] </sup>  as set forth in the FFIEC Call Report for banking institutions and its instructions.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-9" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-9">9</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p>While a loan is in nonaccrual status, a credit union may treat some or all of the cash payments received as interest income on a cash basis provided no doubt exists about the collectability of the remaining <em>recorded investment in the loan.</em> A credit union must handle the reversal of previously accrued, but uncollected, interest applicable to any loan placed in nonaccrual status in accordance with GAAP.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-12" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-12">12</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-741" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-741">Restoration to Accrual Status for All Loans Except Commercial and Member Business Loan Workouts </p>
<p>A nonaccrual loan may be restored to accrual status when: </p>
<p>• Its past due status is less than 90 days and the credit union expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest within a reasonable period; </p>
<p>• It otherwise becomes both <em>well secured</em> and <em>in the process of collection;</em> or </p>
<p>• The asset is a purchased impaired loan and it meets the criteria under GAAP for accrual of interest income under the accretable yield method. See ASC 310–30. </p>
<p>In restoring all loans to accrual status, if the credit union applied any interest payments received while the loan was in nonaccrual status to reduce the recorded investment in the loan, the credit union must not reverse the application of these payments to the loan's recorded investment (and must not credit interest income). Likewise, a credit union cannot restore the accrued but uncollected interest reversed or charged-off at the point the loan was placed on nonaccrual status to accrual; it can only be recognized as income if collected in cash or cash equivalents from the member. </p>

<p>A formally restructured commercial or member business loan workout need not be maintained in nonaccrual status, provided the restructuring and any charge-off taken on the loan are supported by a current, well-documented credit evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment under the revised terms. Otherwise, the restructured loan must remain in nonaccrual status. </p>
<p>The credit union's evaluation must include consideration of the borrower's sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period prior to the date on which the loan is returned to accrual status. A sustained period of repayment performance is a minimum of six consecutive payments, and includes timely payments under the restructured loan's terms of principal and interest in cash or cash equivalents. In returning the commercial or member business workout loan to accrual status, a credit union may consider sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring. Such a restructuring must improve the collectability of the loan in accordance with a reasonable repayment schedule and does not relieve the credit union from the responsibility to promptly charge off all identified losses. </p>
<p>The following graph provides an example of a schedule of repayment performance to demonstrate a determination of six consecutive payments. If the original loan terms required a monthly payment of $1,500, and the credit union lowered the borrower's payment to $1,000 through formal commercial or member business loan restructure, then based on the first row of the graph, the “<em>sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable time prior to the restructuring”</em> would encompass five of the pre-workout consecutive payments that were at least $1,000 (months 1 through 5). In total, the six consecutive repayment burden would be met by the first month post workout (month 6). </p>
<p>In the second row, only one of the pre-workout payments would count toward the six consecutive repayment requirement (month 5), because it is the first month in which the borrower made a payment of at least $1,000 after failing to pay at least that amount. Therefore, the loan would remain on nonaccrual for at least five post-workout consecutive payments (months 6 through 10) provided the borrower continues to make payments consistent with the restructured terms. </p>

The FFIEC Policy sets forth specific limitations on the number of times a loan can be re-aged (for open-end accounts) or extended, deferred, renewed or rewritten (for closed-end accounts). NCUA Letter to Credit Unions (LCU) 09–CU–19, “Evaluating Residential Real Estate Mortgage Loan Modification Programs,” also outlines policy best practices for real estate modifications (<em><a href="https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/evaluating-residential-real-estate-mortgage-loan-modification-programs" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/evaluating-residential-real-estate-mortgage-loan-modification-programs</a></em>). Those best practices remain applicable to real estate loan modifications (with the exception to the capitalization of credit union fees) but could be adapted in part by the credit union in their written loan workout policy for other loans.</p></div>
<div class="footnote" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footnote-5"><p><sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-741-footref-5">5</a>]</sup> Refer to NCUA guidance on charge-offs set forth in LCU 03–CU–01, “Loan Charge-off Guidance,” dated January 2003 (<em><a href="https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/loan-charge-guidance" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/loan-charge-guidance</a></em>). Examiners will require that a reasonable written charge-off policy is in place and that it is consistently applied. Additionally, credit unions need to adjust historical loss factors when calculating ALLL needs for pooled loans to account for any loans with protracted charge-off timeframes (for example, 12 months or more). See discussions on the latter point in the 2006 Interagency ALLL Policy Statement transmitted by Accounting Bulletin 06–1 (December 2006) (<em><a href="https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/interagency-advisory-addressing-alll-key-concepts-and-requirements" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ncua.gov/regulation-supervision/letters-credit-unions-other-guidance/interagency-advisory-addressing-alll-key-concepts-and-requirements</a></em>). Upon implementation of ASC 326—Financial Instruments—Credit Losses, credit unions will use the guidance in Interagency Policy Statement on Allowances for Credit Losses (May 2020) (<em><a href="https://www.ncua.gov/files/press-releases-news/policy-statement-allowances-credit-losses.pdf" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.ncua.gov/files/press-releases-news/policy-statement-allowances-credit-losses.pdf</a></em>).</p></div>

In reporting TDRs on regulatory reports, the data collections will include all TDRs that meet the GAAP criteria for TDR reporting, without the application of materiality threshold exclusions based on scoping or reporting policy elections of credit union preparers or their auditors.

For example, one acceptable method of accounting for such uncollected interest on a loan placed in nonaccrual status is to reverse all of the unpaid interest by crediting the “accrued interest receivable” account on the balance sheet; to reverse the uncollected interest that has been accrued during the calendar year-to-date by debiting the appropriate “interest and fee income on loans” account on the income statement, and to reverse any uncollected interest that had been accrued during previous calendar years by debiting the “allowance for loan and lease losses” account on the balance sheet. The use of this method presumes that credit union management's additions to the allowance through charges to the “provision for loan and lease losses” on the income statement have been based on an evaluation of the collectability of the loan and lease portfolios and the “accrued interest receivable” account.</p></div>

If this method is used, the amount of income that is recognized would be equal to that which would have been accrued on the loan's remaining recorded investment at the contractual rate; and, accounting for the contractual interest in its entirety either as income, reduction of the recorded investment in the asset, or recovery of prior charge-offs, depending on the condition of the asset, consistent with its accounting policies for other financial reporting purposes.</p></div>
