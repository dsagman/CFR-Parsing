<h1>Notice of Proposal to Convert to Non-federally insured Status and Special Meeting of Members
</h1>
<h1>(Insert Name of Converting Credit Union)
</h1>
<p>On (insert date), the board of directors of your credit union approved a proposition to convert from federal share (deposit) insurance to private insurance. You are encouraged to attend a special meeting of our credit union at (insert address) on (insert time and date) to address this proposition.

</h1>
<p>The meeting has two purposes:
</p>
<p>1. To consider and act upon a proposal to convert your account insurance from federal insurance to private insurance.
</p>
<p>2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors in authorizing the officers of the credit union to carry out the proposed conversion.
</p>
<h1>Insurance Conversion
</h1>
<p>Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal government. The basic federal coverage is up to $250,000, but accounts may be structured in different ways, such as joint accounts, payable-on-death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve federal coverage of much more than $250,000. If the conversion is approved, your federal insurance will terminate on the effective date of the conversion. Instead, your accounts in the credit union will be insured up to $(insert dollar amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation chartered by the State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government.

<p>Also, because this conversion, if approved, would result in the loss of federal share insurance, the credit union will, at any time between the approval of the conversion and the effective date of conversion and upon request by the member, permit all members who have share certificates or other term accounts to close the federally insured portion of those accounts without an early withdrawal penalty.

<h1>Notice of Special Meeting on Proposal To Merge and Convert to Non-federally insured Status
</h1>
<h1>(Insert Name of Merging Credit Union)
</h1>
<p>On (insert date), the Board of Directors of your credit union approved a proposition to merge with (insert name of continuing credit union) and to convert from federal share (deposit) insurance to private insurance. You are encouraged to attend a special meeting of our credit union at (insert address) on (insert time and date).
</p>
<h1>Purpose of Meeting
</h1>
<p>The meeting has two purposes:
</p>
<p>1. To consider and act upon a proposal to merge our credit union with (insert name of continuing credit union), the continuing credit union.
</p>
<p>2. To approve the action of the Board of Directors of our credit union in authorizing the officers of the credit union, subject to member approval, to carry out the proposed merger.
</p>
<p>If this merger is approved, our credit union will transfer all its assets and liabilities to the continuing credit union. As a member of our credit union, you will become a member of the continuing credit union. On the effective date of the merger, you will receive shares in the continuing credit union for the shares you own now in our credit union.
</p>
<h1>Insurance Conversion
</h1>
<p>Currently, your accounts have share insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration, an agency of the federal government. The basic federal coverage is up to $250,000, but accounts may be structured in different ways, such as joint accounts, payable-on-death accounts, or IRA accounts, to achieve federal coverage of much more than $250,000. If the merger is approved, your federal insurance will terminate on the effective date of the merger. Instead, your accounts in the credit union will be insured up to $(insert dollar amount) by (insert name of insurer), a corporation chartered by the State of (insert name of State). The federal insurance provided by the National Credit Union Administration is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government. The private insurance you will receive from (insert name of insurer), however, is not guaranteed by the federal or any state or local government.</p>

</tbody></table></div>
<div class="extract">
<p>Also, because this merger, if approved, would result in the loss of federal share insurance, the (insert name of merging credit union) will, at any time between the approval of the merger and the effective date of merger and upon request of the member, permit all members who have share certificates or other term accounts to close the federally insured portion of those accounts without an early withdrawal penalty. (This is an optional sentence. It may be deleted without the approval of the Regional Director. The members must be informed about this right, however, as described in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-708b.204#p-708b.204(c)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 708b.204(c)</a>.)
</p>

The Probable Asset/Share Ratio (PAS) reflects the relative worth of $1 of shares in a credit union, assuming it will be an on-going concern. The ratio is computed by dividing the net value of assets by the credit union's total shares. </p>
<div class="extract">
<p>ADDITIONS: Cash is valued at book less any known potential losses. Loans are valued at book net of probable estimated loan losses (ALLL). Investments are valued at book value less any known losses. However, if a long-term investment is likely to be liquidated prior to maturity, it is valued at current market value. Fixed Assets are valued at book, except when major fixed assets are not in use or are in the process of being sold. In these instances, the asset is valued at its probable market value. Other Assets are valued at the most realistic value to the credit union, usually not to exceed book value.
</p>
<p>DEDUCTIONS: Notes Payable are valued at book. Accounts Payable are valued at book. Other Liabilities are valued at book. Contingent and/or Unrecorded Liabilities are valued at the most realistic known value. This item should include any unrecorded dividends not accrued for the accounting period. Subsidiary Ledger Differences are deducted if the credit union is likely to suffer a loss due to the problem. Other Losses include any other known losses. Do not include deficits in undivided earnings or net losses because they have already reduced assets if properly recorded.
