The “reasonably available” standard requires that the lessor, acting in good faith, exercise due diligence in obtaining information. The lessor may rely on the representations of other parties. For example, the lessor might look to the consumer to determine the purpose for which leased property will be used, to insurance companies for the cost of insurance, or to an automobile manufacturer or dealer for the date of delivery. See commentary to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-213.4#p-213.4(n)" class="cfr external">§ 213.4(n)</a> for estimating official fees and taxes. </p>

A lessor should generally use an accepted trade publication listing estimated current or future market prices for the leased property unless other information or a reasonable belief based on its experience provides the better information. For example: </p>
<p class="indent-2" id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-213(3.)(i.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">i<span class="paren">.</span></span> An automobile lessor offering a three-year open-end lease assigns a wholesale value to the vehicle at the end of the lease term.

The lessor should attempt to provide consumers with clear and understandable descriptions of its early termination charges. Descriptions that are full, accurate, and not intended to be misleading will comply with § 213.4(g)(1), even if the descriptions are complex. In providing a full description of an early termination method, a lessor may use the name of a generally accepted method of computing the unamortized cost portion (also known as the “adjusted lease balance”) of its early termination charges. For example, a lessor may state that the “constant yield” method will be utilized in obtaining the adjusted lease balance, but must specify how that figure, and any other term or figure, is used in computing the total early termination charge imposed upon the consumer. Additionally, if a lessor refers to a named method in this manner, the lessor must provide a written explanation of that method if requested by the consumer. The lessor has the option of providing the explanation as a matter of course in the lease documents or on a separate document. </p>

The total contractual obligation of the lease for the first automobile exceeds the threshold amount in effect when the advertisement is made, but the total contractual obligation of the lease for the second automobile does not exceed the threshold. The entire advertisement must comply with § 213.7 because it refers to a consumer lease that is not exempt. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">7(b) Clear and Conspicuous Standard </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-213(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Standard.</em>  The disclosures in an advertisement in any media must be reasonably understandable. For example, very fine print in a television advertisement or detailed and very rapidly stated information in a radio advertisement does not meet the clear and conspicuous standard if consumers cannot see and read or hear, and cannot comprehend, the information required to be disclosed. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">7(b)(1) Amount due at Lease Signing or Delivery </p>
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-213(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">Itemization not required.</em>  Only a total of amounts due at lease signing or delivery is required to be disclosed, not an itemization of its component parts.

For example, a lessor may not place an asterisk next to the rate and place the notice elsewhere in the advertisement. In addition, with the exception of the notice required by § 213.4(s), the rate cannot be more prominent than any other § 213.4 disclosure stated in the advertisement. </p>

<p class="indent-1" id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-213(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">General rule.</em>  The multiple-page advertisements referred to in § 213.7(c) are advertisements consisting of a series of numbered pages—for example, a supplement to a newspaper. A mailing comprising several separate flyers or pieces of promotional material in a single envelope is not a single multiple-page advertisement. </p>

If one of the triggering terms listed in § 213.7(d)(1) appears in a catalog, or in a multiple-page or electronic advertisement, it must clearly direct the consumer to the page or location where the table, chart, or schedule begins. For example, in an electronic advertisement, a term triggering additional disclosures may be accompanied by a link that directly connects the consumer to the additional information. </p>

In a multi-lease advertisement, an example of one or more typical leases with a statement of all the terms applicable to each may be used. The examples must be labeled as such and must reflect representative lease terms that are made available by the lessor to consumers. </p>

Alternatively, a lessor may provide any telephone number that allows a consumer to reverse the phone charges when calling for information. </p>

Generally, lessors may make certain changes in the format or content of the forms and may delete any disclosures that are inapplicable to a transaction without losing the act's protection from liability. For example, the model form based on monthly periodic payments may be modified for single-payment lease transactions or for quarterly or other regular or irregular periodic payments. The model form may also be modified to reflect that a transaction is an extension. The content, format, and headings for the segregated disclosures must be substantially similar to those contained in the model forms; therefore, any changes should be minimal. The changes to the model forms should not be so extensive as to affect the substance and the clarity of the disclosures. </p>
