The Board may remove an institution-affiliated party from office or prohibit an institution-affiliated party from further participation in any manner in the conduct of an institution's affairs when the person is convicted of such an offense and the conviction is not subject to further direct appellate review. The Board may suspend or remove an institution-affiliated party or prohibit an institution-affiliated party from participation in an institution's affairs in these circumstances if the Board finds that continued service to the financial institution or participation in its affairs by the institution-affiliated party may pose a threat to the interests of the institution's depositors or may threaten to impair public confidence in the financial institution. </p>

<p>Section 39 of the FDI Act requires the Board to establish safety and soundness standards. Pursuant to section 39, a bank may be required to submit a compliance plan if it is not in compliance with a safety and soundness standard established by guideline under section 39(a) or (b). An enforceable order under section 8 may be issued if, after being notified that it is in violation of a safety and soundness standard established under section 39, the bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted plan. This subpart establishes procedures for requiring submission of a compliance plan and issuing an enforceable order pursuant to section 39. </p>
