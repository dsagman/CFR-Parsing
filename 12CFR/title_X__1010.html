<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">(Under this heading the developer is to list the following information:) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">There are certain risks in purchasing real estate that you should be aware of. The following are some of those risks: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The future value of land is uncertain and dependent upon many factors. Do not expect all land to automatically increase in value. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Any value which your lot may have will be affected if roads, utilities and/or amenities cannot be completed or maintained. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Any development will likely have some impact on the surrounding environment. Development which adversely affects the environment may cause governmental agencies to impose restriction on the use of the land. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In the purchase of real estate, many technical requirements must be met to assure that you receive proper title and that you will be able to use the land for its intended purpose. Since this purchase involves a major expenditure of money, it is recommended that you seek professional advice before you obligate yourself. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If adequate provisions have not been made for maintenance of the roads or if the land is not served by publicly maintained roads, you may have to maintain the roads at your expense. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the land is not served by a central sewage system and/or water system, you should contact the local authorities to determine whether a permit will be given for an on-site sewage disposal system and/or well and whether there is an adequate supply of water. You should also become familiar with the requirements for, and the cost of, obtaining electrical service to the lot. </p>
