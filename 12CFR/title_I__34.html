<p>Each institution's policies must be comprehensive, and consistent with safe and sound lending practices, and must ensure that the institution operates within limits and according to standards that are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors. Real estate lending is an integral part of many institutions' business plans and, when undertaken in a prudent manner, will not be subject to examiner criticism. </p>

<p>The lending policy should contain a general outline of the scope and distribution of the institution's credit facilities and the manner in which real estate loans are made, serviced, and collected. In particular, the institution's policies on real estate lending should: </p>
<p>• Identify the geographic areas in which the institution will consider lending. </p>
<p>• Establish a loan portfolio diversification policy and set limits for real estate loans by type and geographic market (e.g., limits on higher risk loans). </p>
<p>• Identify appropriate terms and conditions by type of real estate loan. </p>

<p>• Compliance with all real estate related laws and regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act, anti-discrimination laws, and for savings associations, the Qualified Thrift Lender test. </p>
<p>• Market conditions. </p>
<p>The institution should monitor conditions in the real estate markets in its lending area so that it can react quickly to changes in market conditions that are relevant to its lending decisions. Market supply and demand factors that should be considered include: </p>

<p>Prudently underwritten real estate loans should reflect all relevant credit factors, including: </p>
<p>• The capacity of the borrower, or income from the underlying property, to adequately service the debt. </p>
<p>• The value of the mortgaged property. </p>
<p>• The overall creditworthiness of the borrower. </p>
<p>• The level of equity invested in the property. </p>
<p>• Any secondary sources of repayment. </p>
<p>• Any additional collateral or credit enhancements (such as guarantees, mortgage insurance or takeout commitments). </p>
<p>The lending policies should reflect the level of risk that is acceptable to the board of directors and provide clear and measurable underwriting standards that enable the institution's lending staff to evaluate these credit factors. The underwriting standards should address: </p>
<p>• The maximum loan amount by type of property. </p>
<p>• Maximum loan maturities by type of property. </p>
<p>• Amortization schedules. </p>
<p>• Pricing structure for different types of real estate loans. </p>
<p>• Loan-to-value limits by type of property. </p>
<p>For development and construction projects, and completed commercial properties, the policy should also establish, commensurate with the size and type of the project or property: </p>
<p>• Requirements for feasibility studies and sensitivity and risk analyses (<em>e.g.,</em> sensitivity of income projections to changes in economic variables such as interest rates, vacancy rates, or operating expenses). </p>
<p>• Minimum requirements for initial investment and maintenance of hard equity by the borrower (<em>e.g.,</em> cash or unencumbered investment in the underlying property). </p>
<p>• Minimum standards for net worth, cash flow, and debt service coverage of the borrower or underlying property. </p>
<p>• Standards for the acceptability of and limits on non-amortizing loans. </p>
<p>• Standards for the acceptability of and limits on the use of interest reserves. </p>

</p>
<p class="table-note"><sup>2</sup> A loan-to-value limit has not been established for permanent mortgage or home equity loans on owner-occupied, 1- to 4-family residential property. However, for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90 percent at origination, an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The supervisory loan-to-value limits should be applied to the underlying property that collateralizes the loan. For loans that fund multiple phases of the same real estate project (e.g., a loan for both land development and construction of an office building), the appropriate loan-to-value limit is the limit applicable to the final phase of the project funded by the loan; however, loan disbursements should not exceed actual development or construction outlays. In situations where a loan is fully cross-collateralized by two or more properties or is secured by a collateral pool of two or more properties, the appropriate maximum loan amount under supervisory loan-to-value limits is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property. To ensure that collateral margins remain within the supervisory limits, lenders should redetermine conformity whenever collateral substitutions are made to the collateral pool. </p>
<p>In establishing internal loan-to-value limits, each lender is expected to carefully consider the institution-specific and market factors listed under “Loan Portfolio Management Considerations,” as well as any other relevant factors, such as the particular subcategory or type of loan. For any subcategory of loans that exhibits greater credit risk than the overall category, a lender should consider the establishment of an internal loan-to-value limit for that subcategory that is lower than the limit for the overall category. </p>
<p>The loan-to-value ratio is only one of several pertinent credit factors to be considered when underwriting a real estate loan. Other credit factors to be taken into account are highlighted in the “Underwriting Standards” section above. Because of these other factors, the establishment of these supervisory limits should not be interpreted to mean that loans at these levels will automatically be considered sound. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34">Loans in Excess of the Supervisory Loan-to-Value Limits </p>
<p>The agencies recognize that appropriate loan-to-value limits vary not only among categories of real estate loans but also among individual loans. Therefore, it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits, based on the support provided by other credit factors. Such loans should be identified in the institutions's records, and their aggregate amount reported at least quarterly to the institution's board of directors. (See additional reporting requirements described under “Exceptions to the General Policy.”) </p>
<p>The aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits should not exceed 100 percent of total capital.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34-footnote-2" id="Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  Moreover, within the aggregate limit, total loans for all commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-1-to-4 family residential properties should not exceed 30 percent of total capital. An institution will come under increased supervisory scrutiny as the total of such loans approaches these levels. </p>

<p>In determining the aggregate amount of such loans, institutions should: (a) Include all loans secured by the same property if any one of those loans exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limits; and (b) include the recourse obligation of any such loan sold with recourse. Conversely, a loan should no longer be reported to the directors as part of aggregate totals when reduction in principal or senior liens, or additional contribution of collateral or equity (e.g., improvements to the real property securing the loan), bring the loan-to-value ratio into compliance with supervisory limits. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34">Excluded Transactions </p>
<p>The agencies also recognize that there are a number of lending situations in which other factors significantly outweigh the need to apply the supervisory loan-to-value limits. These include: </p>
<p>• Loans guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its agencies, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit. </p>
<p>• Loans backed by the full faith and credit of a State government, provided that the amount of the assurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit. </p>
<p>• Loans guaranteed or insured by a State, municipal or local government, or an agency thereof, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit, and provided that the lender has determined that the guarantor or insurer has the financial capacity and willingness to perform under the terms of the guaranty or insurance agreement. </p>
<p>• Loans that are to be sold promptly after origination, without recourse, to a financially responsible third party. </p>
<p>• Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured without the advancement of new funds or an increase in the line of credit (except for reasonable closing costs), or loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured in connection with a workout situation, either with or without the advancement of new funds, where consistent with safe and sound banking practices and part of a clearly defined and well-documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, reduce risk of loss, or maximize recovery on the loan. </p>
<p>• Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by the lender in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith. </p>
<p>• Loans for which a lien on or interest in real property is taken as additional collateral through an abundance of caution by the lender (e.g., the institution takes a blanket lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, and the value of the real property is low relative to the aggregate value of all other collateral). </p>
<p>• Loans, such as working capital loans, where the lender does not rely principally on real estate as security and the extension of credit is not used to acquire, develop, or construct permanent improvements on real property. </p>
<p>• Loans for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real property, but not secured by the property, if such security interest is not required by prudent underwriting practice. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Subpart-D-of-Part-34">Exceptions to the General Lending Policy </p>
<p>Some provision should be made for the consideration of loan requests from creditworthy borrowers whose credit needs do not fit within the institution's general lending policy. An institution may provide for prudently underwritten exceptions to its lending policies, including loan-to-value limits, on a loan-by-loan basis. However, any exceptions from the supervisory loan-to-value limits should conform to the aggregate limits on such loans discussed above. </p>
<p>The board of directors is responsible for establishing standards for the review and approval of exception loans. Each institution should establish an appropriate internal process for the review and approval of loans that do not conform to its own internal policy standards. The approval of any such loan should be supported by a written justification that clearly sets forth all of the relevant credit factors that support the underwriting decision. The justification and approval documents for such loans should be maintained as a part of the permanent loan file. Each institution should monitor compliance with its real estate lending policy and individually report exception loans of a significant size to its board of directors. </p>

<p>The real estate lending policies of institutions will be evaluated by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine if the policies are consistent with safe and sound lending practices, these guidelines, and the requirements of the regulation. In evaluating the adequacy of the institution's real estate lending policies and practices, examiners will take into consideration the following factors: </p>
<p>• The nature and scope of the institution's real estate lending activities. </p>
<p>• The size and financial condition of the institution. </p>
<p>• The quality of the institution's management and internal controls. </p>
<p>• The expertise and size of the lending and loan administration staff. </p>
<p>• Market conditions. </p>
<p>Lending policy exception reports will also be reviewed by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine whether the institutions' exceptions are adequately documented and appropriate in light of all of the relevant credit considerations. An excessive volume of exceptions to an institution's real estate lending policy may signal a weakening of its underwriting practices, or may suggest a need to revise the loan policy. </p>

<p>1. <em>Construction-to-permanent loans.</em> Section 34.203 does not apply to a transaction to finance the initial construction of a dwelling. This exclusion applies to a construction-only loan as well as to the construction phase of a construction-to-permanent loan. Section 34.203 does apply, however, to permanent financing that replaces a construction loan, whether the permanent financing is extended by the same or a different creditor, unless the permanent financing is otherwise exempt from the requirements of § 34.203. <em>See</em> § 34.203(b). When a construction loan may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the general disclosure requirements for closed-end credit pursuant to Regulation Z (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1026.17" class="cfr external">12 CFR 1026.17</a>) provide that the creditor may give either one combined disclosure for both the construction financing and the permanent financing, or a separate set of disclosures for each of the two phases as though they were two separate transactions. <em>See</em> <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1026.17#p-1026.17(c)(6)(ii)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 1026.17(c)(6)(ii)</a> and the Official Staff Interpretations to the Bureau's Regulation Z, comment 17(c)(6)–2.

When the creditor discloses the two phases as separate transactions, the annual percentage rate for the permanent phase must be compared to the average prime offer rate for a transaction that is comparable to the permanent financing to determine coverage under § 34.203. When the creditor discloses the two phases as a single transaction, a single annual percentage rate, reflecting the appropriate charges from both phases, must be calculated for the transaction in accordance with <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1026.35#p-1026.35(a)(1)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 1026.35(a)(1)</a> (incorporated into <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-34/subpart-G" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 34, subpart G</a> by § 34.202) and appendix D to 12 CFR part 1026.
