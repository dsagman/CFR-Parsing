<p>The board of directors of a credit union is responsible for establishing a vital records preservation program within 6 months after its insurance certificate is issued. The program must be in writing and contain procedures for maintaining duplicate vital records at a vital records center. The procedures must include: designated staff responsible for vital records preservation, a schedule for the storage and destruction of records, and a records preservation log detailing for each record stored, its name, storage location, storage date, and name of the person sending the record for storage. It is recommended credit unions include in these procedures a method for using duplicate records to restore vital member services in the event of catastrophic act. Credit unions which have some or all of their records maintained by an off-site data processor are considered to be in compliance for the storage of those records if the service agreement specifies the data processor safeguards against the simultaneous destruction of production and back-up information. </p>

<p>A vital records center is defined as a storage facility, which may include another federally insured credit union, at any location far enough from the credit union's offices to avoid the simultaneous loss of both sets of records in the event of a catastrophic act.

</h4>
<p>Credit unions often look to NCUA for guidance on the appropriate length of time to retain various types of operational records. NCUA does not regulate in this area, but as an aid to credit unions it is publishing this appendix of suggested guidelines for record retention. NCUA recognizes that credit unions must strike a balance between the competing demands of space, resource allocation and the desire to retain all the records that they may need to conduct their business successfully. Efficiency requires that all records that are no longer useful be discarded, just as both efficiency and safety require that useful records be preserved and kept readily available. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-749(A.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-749 A.">A. What Format Should the Credit Union Use for Retaining Records? </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">NCUA does not recommend a particular format for record retention. If the credit union stores records on microfilm, microfiche, or in an electronic format, the stored records must be accurate, reproducible and accessible to an NCUA examiner. If records are stored on the credit union premises, they should be immediately accessible upon the examiner's request; if records are stored by a third party or off-site, then they should be made available to the examiner within a reasonable time after the examiner's request. The credit union must maintain the necessary equipment or software to permit an examiner to review and reproduce stored records upon request. The credit union should also ensure that the reproduction is acceptable for submission as evidence in a legal proceeding. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-749(B.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-749 B.">B. Who Is Responsible for Establishing a System for Record Disposal? </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The credit union's board of directors may approve a schedule authorizing the disposal of certain records on a continuing basis upon expiration of specified retention periods. A schedule provides a system for disposal of records and eliminates the need for board approval each time the credit union wants to dispose of the same types of records created at different times. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-749(C.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-749 C.">C. What Procedures Should a Credit Union Follow When Destroying Records? </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The credit union should prepare an index of any records destroyed and retain the index permanently. Destruction of records should ordinarily be carried out by at least two persons whose signatures, attesting to the fact that records were actually destroyed, should be affixed to the listing. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-749(D.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-749(D.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-749 D.">D. What Are the Recommended Minimum Retention Times? </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Record destruction may impact the credit union's legal standing to collect on loans or defend itself in court. Since each state can impose its own rules, it is prudent for a credit union to consider consulting with local counsel when setting minimum retention periods. A record pertaining to a member's account that is not considered a vital record may be destroyed once it is verified by the supervisory committee. Individual Share and Loan Ledgers should be retained permanently. Records, for a particular period, should not be destroyed until both a comprehensive annual audit by the supervisory committee and a supervisory examination by the NCUA have been made for that period. </p>
