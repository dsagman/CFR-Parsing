<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Statistical Model estimates the probability of an insured depository institution failing within three years using a logistic regression and pooled time-series cross-sectional data;<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-1" id="Appendix-A-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  that is, the dependent variable in the estimation is whether an insured depository institution failed during the following three-year period. Actual model parameters for the Statistical Model are an average of each of three regression estimates for each parameter. Each of the three regressions uses end-of-year data from insured depository institutions' quarterly reports of condition and income (Call Reports and Thrift Financial Reports or TFRs<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-2" id="Appendix-A-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-2">2</a>] </sup> ) for every third year to estimate probability of failure within the ensuing three years. One regression (Regression 1) uses insured depository institutions' Call Report and TFR data for the end of 1985 and failures from 1986 through 1988; Call Report and TFR data for the end of 1988 and failures from 1989 through 1991; and so on, ending with Call Report data for the end of 2009 and failures from 2010 through 2012. The second regression (Regression 2) uses insured depository institutions' Call Report and TFR data for the end of 1986 and failures from 1987 through 1989, and so on, ending with Call Report data for the end of 2010 and failures from 2011 through 2013. The third regression (Regression 3) uses insured depository institutions' Call Report and TFR data for the end of 1987 and failures from 1988 through 1990, and so on, ending with Call Report data for the end of 2011 and failures from 2012 through 2014. The regressions include only Call Report data and failures for established small institutions. </p>

<p class="table-note"><sup>1</sup> For purposes of calculating actual assessment rates (as opposed to model estimation), the ratio of Net Income before Taxes to Total Assets is bounded below by (and cannot be less than) –25 percent and is bounded above by (and cannot exceed) 3 percent. For purposes of model estimation only, the ratio of Net Income before Taxes to Total Assets is defined as income (before income taxes and extraordinary items and other adjustments) for the most recent twelve months divided by total assets.
</p>
<p class="table-note"><sup>2</sup> For purposes of calculating actual assessment rates (as opposed to model estimation), “Gross assets” are total assets plus the allowance for loan and lease financing receivable losses (ALLL); for purposes of estimating the Statistical Model, for years before 2001, when allocated transfer risk was not included in ALLL in Call Reports, allocated transfer risk is included in gross assets separately.
</p>
<p class="table-note"><sup>3</sup> Delinquency and non-accrual data on government guaranteed loans are not available for the entire estimation period. As a result, the Statistical Model is estimated without deducting delinquent or past-due government guaranteed loans from the nonperforming loans and leases to gross assets ratio.
</p>
<p class="table-note"><sup>4</sup> The component rating for sensitivity to market risk (the “S” rating) is not available for years before 1997. As a result, and as described in the table, the Statistical Model is estimated using a weighted average of five component ratings excluding the “S” component where the component is not available.
</p>
<p class="table-note"><sup>5</sup> Growth in assets is also adjusted for acquisitions of failed banks.
</p>
<p class="table-note"><sup>6</sup> For purposes of calculating actual assessment rates (as opposed to model estimation), the maximum value of the One-Year Asset Growth measure is 230 percent; that is, asset growth (merger adjusted) over the previous year in excess of 240 percent (230 percentage points in excess of the 10 percent threshold) will not further increase a bank's assessment rate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The financial variable measures used to estimate the failure probabilities are obtained from Call Reports and TFRs. The weighted average of the “C,” “A,” “M,” “E,” “L,”, and “S” component ratings measure is based on component ratings obtained from the most recent bank examination conducted within 24 months before the date of the Call Report or TFR. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Loan Mix Index assigns loans to the categories of loans described in Table A.2. For each loan category, a charge-off rate is calculated for each year from 2001 through 2014. The charge-off rate for each year is the aggregate charge-off rate on all such loans held by small institutions in that year. A weighted average charge-off rate is then calculated for each loan category, where the weight for each year is based on the number of small-bank failures during that year.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-3" id="Appendix-A-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>  A Loan Mix Index for each established small institution is calculated by: (1) multiplying the ratio of the institution's amount of loans in a particular loan category to its total assets by the associated weighted average charge-off rate for that loan category; and (2) summing the products for all loan categories. Table A.2 gives the weighted average charge-off rate for each category of loan, as calculated through the end of 2014. The Loan Mix Index excludes credit card loans. </p>

<p>For certain scorecard measures, a lower ratio implies lower risk and a higher ratio implies higher risk. These measures include: </p>
<p>• Concentration measure; </p>

<p>• Market risk measure; </p>
<p>• Average short-term funding to average total assets ratio; and </p>
<p>• Potential losses to total domestic deposits ratio (loss severity measure). </p>
<p>For those measures, a value between the minimum and maximum cutoff values is converted linearly to a score between 0 and 100, according to the following formula: </p>
<p class="flush-paragraph-2"><em>S</em>  = (<em>V −</em>Min) * 100/(Max −Min), </p>
<p class="flush-paragraph-2">where <em>S</em> is score (rounded to three decimal points), <em>V</em> is the value of the measure, Min is the minimum cutoff value and Max is the maximum cutoff value. </p>
<p>For other scorecard measures, a lower value represents higher risk and a higher value represents lower risk. These measures include: </p>
<p>• Leverage ratio; </p>
<p>• Core earnings to average quarter-end total assets ratio; </p>
<p>• Core deposits to total liabilities ratio; and </p>
<p>• Balance sheet liquidity ratio. </p>
<p>For those measures, a value between the minimum and maximum cutoff values is converted linearly to a score between 0 and 100, according to the following formula: </p>

<p>EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. </p>
<p>Total debt is defined as all interest-bearing financial obligations and includes, but is not limited to, overdrafts, borrowings, repurchase agreements (repos), trust receipts, bankers acceptances, debentures, bonds, loans (including those secured by mortgages), sinking funds, capital (finance) lease obligations (including those obligations that are convertible, redeemable or retractable), mandatory redeemable preferred and trust preferred securities accounted for as liabilities in accordance with ASC Subtopic 480–10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity—Overall (formerly FASB Statement No. 150, “Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity”), and subordinated capital notes. Total debt excludes pension obligations, deferred tax liabilities and preferred equity. </p>
<p>Senior debt includes any portion of total debt that has a priority claim on any of the borrower's assets. A priority claim is a claim that entitles the holder to priority of payment over other debt holders in bankruptcy. </p>
<p>When calculating either of the borrower's operating leverage ratios, the only permitted EBITDA adjustments are those specifically permitted for that borrower in the loan agreement (at the time of underwriting) and only funded amounts of lines of credit must be considered debt. </p>
<p>The debt-to-EBITDA ratio must be calculated using the consolidated financial statements of the borrower. If the loan is made to a subsidiary of a larger organization, the debt-to-EBITDA ratio may be calculated using the financial statements of the subsidiary or, if the parent company has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the borrower's debt, using the consolidated financial statements of the parent company. </p>
<p>In the case of a merger of two companies or the acquisition of one or more companies or parts of companies, pro-forma debt is to be used as well as the trailing twelve-month pro-forma EBITDA for the combined companies. When calculating the trailing pro-forma EBITDA for the combined company, no adjustments are allowed for economies of scale or projected cost savings that may be realized subsequent to the acquisition unless specifically permitted for that borrower under the loan agreement. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Exclusions </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Cash Collateral Exclusion </p>
<p>To exclude a loan based on cash collateral, the cash must be in the form of a savings or time deposit held by a bank. The bank (or lead bank or agent bank in the case of a participation or syndication) must have a perfected first priority security interest, a security agreement, and a collateral assignment of the deposit account that is irrevocable for the remaining term of the loan or commitment. In addition, the bank must place a hold on the deposit account that alerts the bank's employees to an attempted withdrawal. If the cash collateral is held at another bank or at multiple banks, a security agreement must be in place and each bank must have an account control agreement in place.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-7" id="Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-7">7</a>] </sup>  For the exclusion to apply to a revolving line of credit, the cash collateral must be equal to or greater than the amount of the total loan commitment (the aggregate funded and unfunded balance of the loan). </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Asset-Based and Floor Plan Lending Exclusions </p>
<p>The FDIC retains the authority to verify that banks have sound internal controls and administration practices for asset-based and floor plan loans that are excluded from a bank's reported higher-risk C&amp;I loans and securities totals. If the bank's PFR has cited a criticism of the bank's controls or administration of its asset-based or floor plan loan portfolios in an MRA, the bank is not eligible for the asset-based or floor plan lending exclusions. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Asset-Based Lending Conditions </p>

When an appraisal is obtained, or there is a readily determinable market price for the inventory, however, up to 85 percent of the net orderly liquidation value (NOLV) or the market price of the inventory may be financed. Inventory must be valued or appraised by an independent third-party appraiser using NOLV, fair value, or forced sale value (versus a “going concern” value), whichever is appropriate, to arrive at a net realizable value. Appraisals are to be prepared in accordance with industry standards, unless there is a readily available and determinable market price for the inventory (<em>e.g.,</em> in the case of various commodities), from a recognized exchange or third-party industry source, and a readily available market (<em>e.g.,</em> for aluminum, crude oil, steel, and other traded commodities); in that case, inventory may be valued using current market value. When relying upon current market value rather than an independent appraisal, the reporting bank's management must update the value of inventory as market prices for the product change. Valuation updates must be as frequent as needed to ensure compliance with margin requirements. In addition, appropriate mark-to-market reserves must be established to protect against excessive inventory price fluctuations. An asset has a readily identifiable and publicly available market price if the asset's price is quoted routinely in a widely disseminated publication that is readily available to the general public. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Definitions </p>
<p>Higher-risk consumer loans are defined as all consumer loans where, as of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, the probability of default (PD) within two years (the two-year PD) is greater than 20 percent, excluding those consumer loans that meet the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-9" id="Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-9">9</a>, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-10" id="Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-10">10</a>] </sup>  </p>

To exclude a loan based on cash collateral, the cash must be in the form of a savings or time deposit held by a bank. The lending bank (or lead or agent bank in the case of a participation or syndication) must, in all cases, (including instances in which cash collateral is held at another bank or banks) have a perfected first priority security interest under applicable state law, a security agreement in place, and all necessary documents executed and measures taken as required to result in such perfection and priority. In addition, the lending bank must place a hold on the deposit account that alerts the bank's employees to an attempted withdrawal. For the exclusion to apply to a revolving line of credit, the cash collateral must be equal to, or greater than, the amount of the total loan commitment (the aggregate funded and unfunded balance of the loan). </p>
<p>Banks must determine the PD of a consumer loan as of the date the loan was originated, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of the date it was refinanced. The two-year PD must be estimated using an approach that conforms to the requirements detailed herein. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Loans Originated or Refinanced Before April 1, 2013, and all Acquired Loans </p>
<p>For loans originated or refinanced by a bank before April 1, 2013, and all acquired loans regardless of the date of acquisition, if information as of the date the loan was originated or refinanced is not available, then the bank must use the oldest available information to determine the PD. If no information is available, then the bank must obtain recent, refreshed data from the borrower or other appropriate third party to determine the PD. Refreshed data is defined as the most recent data available, and must be as of a date that is no earlier than three months before the acquisition of the loan. In addition, for loans acquired on or after April 1, 2013, the acquiring bank shall have six months from the date of acquisition to determine the PD. </p>
<p>When a bank acquires loans from another entity on a recurring or programmatic basis, the acquiring bank may determine whether the loan meets the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender only if the acquiring bank verifies the information provided. Loans acquired from another entity are acquired on a recurring basis if a bank has acquired other loans from that entity at least once within the calendar year of the acquisition of the loans in question or in the previous calendar year. If the acquiring bank cannot or does not verify the information provided by the original lender, the acquiring bank must obtain the necessary information from the borrower or other appropriate third party to make its own determination of whether the purchased assets should be classified as a higher-risk consumer loan. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Loans That Meet Both Higher-Risk Consumer Loans and Nontraditional Mortgage Loans Definitions </p>
<p>A loan that meets both the nontraditional mortgage loan and higher-risk consumer loan definitions at the time of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, must be reported only as a nontraditional mortgage loan. If, however, the loan ceases to meet the nontraditional mortgage loan definition but continues to meet the definition of a higher-risk consumer loan, the loan is to be reported as a higher-risk consumer loan. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">General Requirements for PD Estimation </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Scorable Consumer Loans </p>
<p>Estimates of the two-year PD for a loan must be based on the observed, stress period default rate (defined herein) for loans of a similar product type made to consumers with credit risk comparable to the borrower being evaluated. While a bank may consider additional risk factors beyond the product type and credit score (<em>e.g.,</em> geography) in estimating the PD of a loan, it must at a minimum account for these two factors. The credit risk assessment must be determined using third party or internal scores derived using a scoring system that qualifies as <em>empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound</em> as defined in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-202.2#p-202.2(p)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 202.2(p)</a>, as it may be amended from time to time, and has been approved by the bank's model risk oversight and governance process and internal audit mechanism. In the case of a consumer loan with a co-signer or co-borrower, the PD may be determined using the most favorable individual credit score. </p>
<p>In estimating the PD based on such scores, banks must adhere to the following requirements: </p>

The observed default rate for each band must be assumed to correspond to the midpoint of the range for the band. For example, if one score band ranges from 621 to 625 and has an observed default rate of 4 percent, while the next lowest band ranges from 616 to 620 and has an observed default rate of 6 percent, a 620 score must be assigned a default rate of 5.2 percent, calculated as </p>

<p>For unscorable consumer loans—where the available information about a borrower is insufficient to determine a credit score—the bank will be unable to assign a PD to the loan according to the requirements described above. If the total outstanding balance of the unscorable consumer loans of a particular product type (including, but not limited to, student loans) exceeds 5 percent of the total outstanding balance for that product type, including both foreign and domestic loans, the excess amount shall be treated as higher risk (the de minimis approach). Otherwise, the total outstanding balance of unscorable consumer loans of a particular product type will not be considered higher risk. The consumer product types used to determine whether the 5 percent test is satisfied shall correspond to the product types listed in the table used for reporting PD estimates. </p>
<p>A bank may not develop PD estimates for unscorable loans based on internal data. </p>
<p>If, after the origination or refinance of the loan, an unscorable consumer loan becomes scorable, a bank must reclassify the loan using a PD estimated according to the general requirements above. Based upon that PD, the loan will be determined to be either higher risk or not, and that determination will remain in effect until a refinancing occurs, at which time the loan must be re-evaluated. An unscorable loan must be reviewed at least annually to determine if a credit score has become available. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph"><em class="paragraph-heading">Alternative Methodologies</em> </p>
<p>A bank may use internally derived default rates that were calculated using fewer observations or score bands than those specified above under certain conditions. The bank must submit a written request to the FDIC either in advance of, or concurrent with, reporting under the requested approach. The request must explain in detail how the proposed approach differs from the rule specifications and the bank must provide support for the statistical appropriateness of the proposed methodology. The request must include, at a minimum, a table with the default rates and number of observations used in each score and product segment. The FDIC will evaluate the proposed methodology and may request additional information from the bank, which the bank must provide. The bank may report using its proposed approach while the FDIC evaluates the methodology. If, after reviewing the request, the FDIC determines that the bank's methodology is unacceptable, the bank will be required to amend its Call Reports and report according to the generally applicable specifications for PD estimation. The bank will be required to submit amended information for no more than the two most recently dated and filed Call Reports preceding the FDIC's determination. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph"><em class="paragraph-heading">Foreign Consumer Loans</em> </p>
<p>A bank must estimate the PD of a foreign consumer loan according to the general requirements described above unless doing so would be unduly complex or burdensome (<em>e.g.,</em> if a bank had to develop separate PD mappings for many different countries). A bank may request to use default rates calculated using fewer observations or score bands than the specified minimums, either in advance of, or concurrent with, reporting under that methodology, but must comply with the requirements detailed above for using an alternative methodology. </p>
<p>When estimating a PD according to the general requirements described above would be unduly complex or burdensome, a bank that is required to calculate PDs for foreign consumer loans under the requirements of the Basel II capital framework may: (1) Use the Basel II approach discussed herein, subject to the terms discussed herein; (2) submit a written request to the FDIC to use its own methodology, but may not use the methodology until approved by the FDIC; or (3) treat the loan as an unscorable consumer loan subject to the de minimis approach described above. </p>

<p>When a bank submits a written request to the FDIC to use its own methodology, the FDIC may request additional information from the bank regarding the proposed methodology and the bank must provide the information. The FDIC may grant a bank tentative approval to use the methodology while the FDIC considers it in more detail. If the FDIC ultimately disapproves the methodology, the bank may be required to amend its Call Reports; however, the bank will be required to amend no more than the two most recently dated and filed Call Reports preceding the FDIC's determination. In the amended Call Reports, the bank must treat any loan whose PD had been estimated using the disapproved methodology as an unscorable domestic consumer loan subject to the de minimis approach described above. </p>

<p>Nontraditional mortgage loans include all residential loan products that allow the borrower to defer repayment of principal or interest and include all interest-only products, teaser rate mortgages, and negative amortizing mortgages, with the exception of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) or reverse mortgages. A teaser-rate mortgage loan is defined as a mortgage with a discounted initial rate where the lender offers a lower rate and lower payments for part of the mortgage term. A mortgage loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the teaser rate has expired. An interest-only loan is no longer considered a nontraditional mortgage loan once the loan begins to amortize. </p>
<p>Banks must determine whether residential loans meet the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan as of origination, or, if the loan has been refinanced, as of refinance, as refinance is defined in this Appendix for purposes of higher-risk consumer loans. When a bank acquires a residential loan, it must determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender. If this information is unavailable, the bank must obtain refreshed data from the borrower or other appropriate third party. Refreshed data for residential loans is defined as the most recent data available. The data, however, must be as of a date that is no earlier than three months before the acquisition of the residential loan. The acquiring bank must also determine whether an acquired loan is higher risk not later than three months after acquisition. </p>
<p>When a bank acquires loans from another entity on a recurring or programmatic basis, however, the acquiring bank may determine whether the loan meets the definition of a nontraditional mortgage loan using the origination criteria and analysis performed by the original lender only if the acquiring bank verifies the information provided. Loans acquired from another entity are acquired on a recurring basis if a bank has acquired other loans from that entity at least once within the calendar year or the previous calendar year of the acquisition of the loans in question. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327(I.)(A.)(5.)" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327 I.A.5.">5. Higher-Risk Securitizations </p>
<p>Higher-risk securitizations are defined as securitization exposures (except securitizations classified as trading book), where, in aggregate, more than 50 percent of the assets backing the securitization meet either the criteria for higher-risk C &amp; I loans or securities, higher-risk consumer loans, or nontraditional mortgage loans, except those classified as trading book. A securitization exposure is as defined in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-324.2" class="cfr external">12 CFR 324.2</a>, as it may be amended from time to time. A higher-risk securitization excludes the maximum amount that is recoverable from the U.S. government under guarantee or insurance provisions. </p>
<p>A bank must determine whether a securitization is higher risk based upon information as of the date of issuance (<em>i.e.,</em> the date the securitization is sold on a market to the public for the first time). The bank must make this determination within the time limit that would apply under this Appendix if the bank were directly acquiring loans or securities of the type underlying the securitization. In making the determination, a bank must use one of the following methods: </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327(I.)(A.)(5.)(a)">
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327(I.)(A.)(5.)(a)" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327 I.A.5.(a)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>a<span class="paren">)</span></span> For a securitization collateralized by a static pool of loans, whose underlying collateral changes due to the sale or amortization of these loans, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, owned by the securitization on the date of issuance of the securitization. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327(I.)(A.)(5.)(b)">
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327(I.)(A.)(5.)(b)" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327 I.A.5.(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> For a securitization collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans, whose underlying collateral may change by the purchase of additional assets, including purchases made during a ramp-up period, the 50 percent threshold is to be determined based upon the highest amount of higher-risk assets, as defined in this Appendix, allowable under the portfolio guidelines of the securitization. </p>
<p>A bank is not required to evaluate a securitization on a continuous basis when the securitization is collateralized by a dynamic pool of loans; rather, the bank is only required to evaluate the securitization once. </p>
<p>A bank is required to use the information that is reasonably available to a sophisticated investor in reasonably determining whether a securitization meets the 50 percent threshold. Information reasonably available to a sophisticated investor includes, but is not limited to, offering memoranda, indentures, trustee reports, and requests for information from servicers, collateral managers, issuers, trustees, or similar third parties. When determining whether a revolving trust or similar securitization meets the threshold, a bank may use established criteria, model portfolios, or limitations published in the offering memorandum, indenture, trustee report, or similar documents. </p>
<p>Sufficient information necessary for a bank to make a definitive determination may not, in every case, be reasonably available to the bank as a sophisticated investor. In such a case, the bank may exercise its judgment in making the determination. In some cases, the bank need not rely upon all of the aforementioned pieces of information to make a higher-risk determination if fewer documents provide sufficient data to make the determination. </p>
<p>In cases in which a securitization is required to be consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and a bank has access to the necessary information, a bank may opt for an alternative method of evaluating the securitization to determine whether it is higher risk. The bank may evaluate individual loans in the securitization on a loan-by-loan basis and only report as higher risk those loans that meet the definition of a higher-risk asset; any loan within the securitization that does not meet the definition of a higher-risk asset need not be reported as such. When making this evaluation, the bank must follow the provisions of section I.B herein. Once a bank evaluates a securitization for higher-risk asset designation using this alternative evaluation method, it must continue to evaluate all securitizations that it has consolidated on the balance sheet as a result of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167, and for which it has the required information, using the alternative evaluation method. For securitizations for which the bank does not have access to information on a loan-by-loan basis, the bank must determine whether the securitization meets the 50 percent threshold in the manner previously described for other securitizations. </p>

</h4>
<p>The loss severity measure applies a standardized set of assumptions to an institution's balance sheet to measure possible losses to the FDIC in the event of an institution's failure. To determine an institution's loss severity rate, the FDIC first applies assumptions about uninsured deposit and other unsecured liability runoff, and growth in insured deposits, to adjust the size and composition of the institution's liabilities. Assets are then reduced to match any reduction in liabilities.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-D-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-1" id="Appendix-D-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  The institution's asset values are then further reduced so that the Leverage ratio reaches 2 percent.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-D-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-2" id="Appendix-D-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-2">2</a>, <a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-D-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footnote-3" id="Appendix-D-to-Subpart-A-of-Part-327-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>  In both cases, assets are adjusted pro rata to preserve the institution's asset composition. Assumptions regarding loss rates at failure for a given asset category and the extent of secured liabilities are then applied to estimated assets and liabilities at failure to determine whether the institution has enough unencumbered assets to cover domestic deposits. Any projected shortfall is divided by current domestic deposits to obtain an end-of-period loss severity ratio. The loss severity measure is an average loss severity ratio for the three most recent quarters of data available. </p>

To determine an institution's loss severity rate, the FDIC first applies assumptions about uninsured deposit and other liability runoff, and growth in insured deposits, to adjust the size and composition of the institution's liabilities. Exclude total outstanding borrowings from Federal Reserve Banks under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility from short-and long-term secured borrowings, as appropriate. Assets are then reduced to match any reduction in liabilities. Exclude from an institution's balance of commercial and industrial loans the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program. In the event that the outstanding balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program exceeds the balance of commercial and industrial loans, exclude any remaining balance of loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program first from the balance of all other loans, up to the total amount of all other loans, followed by the balance of agricultural loans, up to the total amount of agricultural loans. Increase cash balances by outstanding loans provided under the Paycheck Protection Program that exceed total outstanding borrowings from Federal Reserve Banks under the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility, if any. The institution's asset values are then further reduced so that the Leverage Ratio reaches 2 percent. In both cases, assets are adjusted pro rata to preserve the institution's asset composition. Assumptions regarding loss rates at failure for a given asset category and the extent of secured liabilities are then applied to estimated assets and liabilities at failure to determine whether the institution has enough unencumbered assets to cover domestic deposits. Any projected shortfall is divided by current domestic deposits to obtain an end-of-period loss severity ratio. The loss severity measure is an average loss severity ratio for the three most recent quarters of data available. The applicable portions of the current expected credit loss methodology (CECL) transitional amounts attributable to the allowance for credit losses on loans and leases held for investment and added to retained earnings for regulatory capital purposes pursuant to the regulatory capital regulations, as they may be amended from time to time (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-3" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 3</a>, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-217" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 217</a>, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-324" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 324</a>, <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/85-FR-61577" class="fr-reference" data-reference="85 FR 61577">85 FR 61577</a> (Sept. 30, 2020), and <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/84-FR-4222" class="fr-reference" data-reference="84 FR 4222">84 FR 4222</a> (Feb. 14, 2019)), will be removed from the calculation of the loss severity measure. </p>
