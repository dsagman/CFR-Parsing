It does not apply to the purchase of an investment interest in a pool of loans.

This section applies only to a federally insured credit union's purchase of a loan participation where the borrower is not a member of that credit union and where a continuing contractual obligation between the seller and purchaser is contemplated. Generally, a federal credit union's purchase of all or part of a loan made to one of its own members, subject to a limited exception for certain well capitalized federal credit unions in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-701.23#p-701.23(b)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 701.23(b)(2)</a>, where no continuing contractual obligation between the seller and purchaser is contemplated, is governed by <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-701/section-701.23" class="cfr external">§ 701.23 of this part</a>.

If certain lending policies or procedures do presume group characteristics, they may violate the Fair Housing Act, even though the characteristics are not based upon race, color, sex, national origin, religion, handicap, or familial status. Such a violation occurs when otherwise facially nondiscriminatory lending procedures (either general lending policies or specific criteria used in reviewing loan applications) have the effect of making real estate-related loans unavailable or less available on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, handicap, or familial status. Note, however, that a policy or criterion which has a discriminatory effect is not a violation of the Fair Housing Act if its use achieves a legitimate business necessity which cannot be achieved by using less discriminatory standards. It is also important to note that the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B prohibit discrimination, either per se or in effect, on the basis of the applicant's age, marital status, receipt of public assistance, or the exercise of any rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. </p>

For purposes of clarification, the prohibited use of location factors in this section is intended to prevent abandonment of areas in which a Federal credit union's members live or want to live. It is not intended to require loans in those areas that are geographically remote from the FCU's main or branch offices or that contravene the parameters of a Federal credit union's charter. Further, this prohibition does not preclude requiring a borrower to obtain flood insurance protection pursuant to the National Flood Insurance Act and part 760 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, nor does it preclude involvement with Federal or state housing insurance programs which provide for lower interest rates for the purchase of homes in certain urban or rural areas. Also, the legitimate use of location factors in an appraisal does not constitute a violation of the provision of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-701.31#p-701.31(b)(3)" class="cfr external">paragraph (b)(3)</a> of this section, which prohibits consideration of location of the dwelling. Finally, the prohibited use of prior home ownership does not preclude a Federal credit union from considering an applicant's payment history on a loan which was made to obtain a home. Such action entails consideration of the payment record on a previous loan in determining creditworthiness; it does not entail consideration of prior home ownership. </p>

These factors will most often be those location factors which may negatively affect the short range future value (up to 3–5 years) of a property. Factors which in some cases may cause the market value of a property to decline are recent zoning changes or a significant number of abandoned homes in the immediate vicinity of the property. However, not all zoning changes will cause a decline in property values, and proximity to abandoned buildings may not affect the market value of a property because the cause of abandonment is unrelated to high risk. Proper considerations include the condition and utility of the improvement and various physical factors such as street conditions, amenities such as parks and recreation areas, availability of public utilities and municipal services, and exposure to flooding and land faults. </p></div>

<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701">Introduction </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Effective Date </p>
<p>The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Board first incorporated the Federal Credit Union (FCU) Bylaws as Appendix A to Part 701 of the NCUA's regulations on November 30, 2007. FCUs may retain previously adopted versions of the FCU Bylaws including the November 30, 2007 version. Unless an FCU has adopted bylaws before January 2, 2020, it must adopt these revised bylaws. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Adoption of All or Part of These Bylaws </p>
<p>Although FCUs may retain any previously approved version of the FCU Bylaws, the NCUA Board encourages FCUs to adopt the revised bylaws because it believes they provide greater clarity and flexibility for credit unions and their officials and members. FCUs may also adopt portions of the revised bylaws and retain the remainder of previously approved bylaws, but the NCUA Board cautions FCUs to be extremely careful in making the decision. FCUs must be careful because they run the risk of having inconsistent or conflicting provisions because of the various options the revised bylaws provide, as well as other revisions in the text. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Bylaw Amendments </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(1.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The FCU Bylaws contain provisions allowing FCU boards to select from an option or range of options or to fill in a blank. The “fill-in-the-blank” provisions are changes to the FCU's bylaws. Thus, they require a two-thirds vote of the FCU's board of directors. As long as the board selects from the permissible options, the FCU does not need to submit the change to the NCUA for its approval. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(2.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> FCUs continue to have the flexibility to request bylaw amendments. The NCUA must approve all bylaw amendments except for the provisions noted above. In the past, the NCUA has published a “Standard Bylaw Amendments” booklet containing a list of “standard” preapproved and optional amendments not included in the FCU Bylaws. That document remains on the NCUA's website for historical purposes. However, FCUs may not adopt amendments from the “Standard Bylaw Amendments” booklet, as the FCU Bylaws include sufficient flexibility to make a separate list of standard bylaw amendments unnecessary. Thus, the NCUA no longer makes a distinction between “standard” and “nonstandard” bylaw amendments. Consequently, the NCUA considers any change to the FCU Bylaws that is not a “fill-in-the-blank” provision or part of a range of options to be a bylaw amendment that requires the NCUA approval. </p>

If CURE does not reach a decision within 60 days, the proposed amendment is considered to be denied unless CURE requests an extension of time from the federal credit union and the credit union agrees to such a request. If CURE reaches an adverse decision or CURE fails to render a decision within the agreed timeframe, the credit union may appeal that decision in accordance with the procedures set out in subpart B to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-746" class="cfr external">part 746 of this chapter</a>. If CURE fails to render a timely decision, within thirty days it must provide the FCU with a written notice of its failure to render a timely decision and a statement of any concerns that CURE has with the bylaw amendment request. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Because each decision by CURE is made on a case-by-case basis that depends on the unique facts and circumstances applicable to each FCU, the credit union must submit a proposed amendment to the NCUA for review under the procedure listed above, even if the NCUA previously approved an identical or similar amendment for another credit union. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">The Nature of the FCU Bylaws </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(1.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The Federal Credit Union Act requires the NCUA Board to prepare bylaws for federal credit unions.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footnote-2" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  The FCU Bylaws address a broad range of matters concerning a credit union's organization and governance, the relationship of the credit union to its members, and the procedures and rules a credit union follows. </p>

<p>The FCU Bylaws supplement the broad provisions of: </p>
<p>• A federal credit union's charter, which establishes the existence of a federal credit union; </p>
<p>• The Federal Credit Union Act, which establishes the powers of federal credit unions; and </p>
<p>• The NCUA's regulations, which implement the Federal Credit Union Act. </p>
<p>As a legal matter, a federal credit union's bylaws must conform to, and cannot be inconsistent with, any provision of its charter, the Federal Credit Union Act, the NCUA's regulations, or other laws or regulations applicable to the credit union's operations. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(2.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The NCUA expects federal credit unions and their members will make every effort to resolve bylaw disputes using the credit union's internal member complaint resolution process. If a bylaw dispute cannot be resolved internally, credit union officials or members should contact the regional office with oversight over the credit union for assistance in resolving the dispute. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(3.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The NCUA has discretion to take administrative actions when a credit union is not in compliance with its bylaws. If a potential violation is identified, the NCUA will carefully consider all of the facts and circumstances in deciding whether to take enforcement action. The NCUA will not generally take action against minor or technical violations, but emphasizes that it retains discretion to enforce the FCU Bylaws in appropriate cases, such as safety and soundness concerns or threats to fundamental, material credit union member rights. </p>

The notice must provide information on the effect of the expulsion, including information related to account access and any deductions by the credit union related to amounts due.

However, the board can appoint membership officers from among the members of the credit union. Such membership officers cannot be a paid officer of the board, the financial board officer, any assistant to the paid officer of the board or to the financial officer, or any loan officer. As described under section 2 of this Article, an applicant becomes a member upon approval by a membership officer and payment of at least one share (or installment) and uniform entrance fee, if applicable. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">(iii) <em>Violent, belligerent, disruptive, or abusive members:</em> Many credit unions have confronted the issue of handling a violent, belligerent, disruptive, or abusive individual. Doing so is not a simple matter insofar as it requires the credit union to balance the need to preserve the safety of individual staff, other members, and the integrity of the workplace, on one hand, with the rights of the affected member on the other. In accordance with the Act and applicable legal interpretations, there is a reasonably wide range within which FCUs may fashion a policy that addresses these interrelated responsibilities. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Thus, an individual who has become violent, belligerent, disruptive, or abusive may be prohibited from entering the premises or making telephone contact with the credit union, and the individual may be severely restricted in terms of eligibility for products or services. So long as the individual is not barred from exercising the right to vote at annual meetings and is allowed to maintain a regular share account, the FCU may fashion and implement a policy that is reasonably designed to preserve the safety of its employees and the integrity of the workplace. The policy need not be identical nor applied uniformly in all cases; there is room for flexibility and a customized approach to fit the circumstances. In fact, the NCUA anticipates that in some circumstances, such as violence or a credible threat of violence against another member or credit union staff in the FCU or its surrounding property, an FCU may take immediate action to restrict most, if not all, services to the member. This may occur along a parallel track as the credit union begins the process of expelling the member under Article XIV. In other situations, such as a member who frequently writes checks with insufficient funds, the FCU may attempt to resolve the matter with the member before limiting check writing services. Once a limitation of services policy is adopted or revised, members must receive notice. The FCU should disclose the policy to new members when they join and notify existing members of the policy at least 30 calendar days before it becomes effective. The credit union's board has the option to adopt the amendment addressing members in good standing. </p>

A differing par value may also be permissible for different types of accounts, such as requiring a higher par value for a member with only a share draft account. If a credit union adopts differing par values, all of the possible par values must be stated in section 1. The FCU Bylaws include several options for differing par values.

<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-701(v.%20Trusts)" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">v. Trusts:</em>   Trusts and shares issued in trust can be a complicated subject. For purposes of the FCU Bylaws, perhaps the main issue is the distinction between revocable and irrevocable trusts. In the case of a revocable trust, the individual who establishes the trust is essentially still in control of the funds during his lifetime. Thus, the account owner can change the designated beneficiary at any time, and he or she can determine whether the identified beneficiary actually receives any money simply by deciding to withdraw the funds before his or her own death. Accordingly, the requirement in the case of revocable trust accounts is simply that the owner of the funds be a member of the FCU. Furthermore, provided the owner of the funds is within the field of membership and eligible for membership, he or she may use the vehicle of the payable-on-death or revocable trust account itself as the method of becoming a member. There is no requirement that the account holder first establish a regular share account to become a member. In accordance with legal opinions issued by the NCUA's Office of General Counsel, an individual may fulfill the requirement of becoming a member by subscribing to the equivalent of the par value of one share, which can be done through the opening of any type of account the credit union offers.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footnote-6" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footref-6">6</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">There is no requirement that the beneficiaries be members, since they may never actually come to own the funds or have a right to them. Furthermore, in the case of a revocable trust, since it is essentially indistinguishable from the member, there is no need for the trust to have a separate account number assigned or for it to be viewed as a legal entity separate from the member who set it up. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In the case of an irrevocable trust, the requirements are somewhat different. Membership requirements here may be met though either the settlor, who is the original owner of the funds, or the beneficiary, who obtains an equitable, beneficial interest in the funds once the trust is established. So long as one or the other is eligible for membership, the credit union may accept the account. Furthermore, as with revocable trusts, the membership obligation can be met through the opening of the trust account itself; it is not required that the beneficiary or the settlor have previously established a separate, regular share account. Most irrevocable trusts have a trustee who has administrative responsibility for the account, and so the credit union will typically deal with the trustee for purposes such as sending monthly statements and year-end tax reporting. However, the trustee need not actually be a member of the credit union, and the credit union need not necessarily view the trust account as a separate legal entity, with its own separate tax ID number. Instead, it need only verify and confirm the eligibility of either the settlor or the beneficiary (or all of the settlors or all of the beneficiaries in the case of multiple settlors or beneficiaries) to join the credit union. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A trust itself, either revocable or irrevocable, may be a member of the credit union in its own right if all parties to the trust, including all settlors, beneficiaries and trustees, are within the field of membership.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footnote-7" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footref-7">7</a>] </sup>  If all parties to the trust are within a credit union's field of membership, the trust will qualify as “an organization of such persons,” which is a standard clause in FCU fields of membership. </p>

A credit union can limit services under Article II for a member not in good standing. A credit union may also expel the member for cause after a two-thirds vote of the credit union's directors.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footnote-11" id="Appendix-A-to-Part-701-footref-11">11</a>] </sup>  Dangerous and abusive behavior is considered any violent, belligerent, unreasonably disruptive, or abusive behavior. Examples of dangerous and abusive conduct include, but are not limited to, a member threatening physical harm to employees, a member repeatedly and unwelcomely giving gifts to or asking tellers on dates, a member repeatedly using racial or sexist language towards employees, and a member threatening to follow a loan officer home for denying a loan. </p>

<p>A credit union must provide notice of the expulsion to the member. The notice must include the reason for the expulsion, and if a hearing was conducted or written testimony provided, the credit union should provide a response to the member's statements. The notice must be specific and not just include conclusory statements regarding the reason for the member's expulsion. For example, a general statement that the member's behavior has been deemed abusive and the member is being subject to expulsion procedures would be insufficient as an explanation. A credit union is prohibited from expelling a class of members under this provision. That would include a board acting to remove all delinquent members or class of delinquent members. </p>
<p>If a special meeting of the members is called to expel the member, only in-person voting is permitted in conjunction with the special meeting, so that the affected member has an opportunity to present the member's case and respond to the credit union's concerns. However, an in-person meeting is not required if a member is expelled by a two-thirds vote of the board of directors. In addition, FCUs should consider the commentary under Article XVI about members using accounts for unlawful purposes. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Optional Standard Disclosure of Expulsion Policy </p>
<p>We may terminate your membership in [name of FCU] in one of three ways. The first way is through a special meeting. Under this option, we may call a special meeting of the members, provide you an opportunity to be heard, and obtain a two-thirds vote of the members present at the special meeting in favor of your expulsion. The second way to terminate your membership is under a nonparticipation policy given to each member that follows certain requirements. The third way to terminate your membership is by a two-thirds vote of a quorum of the directors of the credit union for cause. </p>
<p>Cause is defined as follows: (A) a substantial or repeated violation of [name of membership agreement] with [us]; (B) a substantial or repeated disruption, including dangerous or abusive behavior, to the credit union's operations; or (C) fraud, attempted fraud, or a conviction of other illegal conduct that a member has been convicted of in relation to [us], including in connection with our employees conducting business on behalf of us. </p>
<p>Before the board votes on an expulsion, [we] must provide written notice to your mail address (or email, if applicable) on record or personally provide the written notice. [We] must provide the specific reasons for the expulsion and allow you an opportunity to rebut those reasons through a hearing if you choose. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information with [us] up to date, and to open and read notices from [us]. Unless [we] determine to allow otherwise, there is no right to an in-person hearing with the board. If you fail to request a hearing within 60 calendar days of receipt of the notice, you will be expelled. You may submit any complaints about your pending expulsion or expulsion to NCUA's Consumer Assistance Center if the complaint cannot be resolved with the credit union. </p>
<p>[We] will confirm any expulsion with a letter with information on the effect of the expulsion and how you can request reinstatement. Expulsion or withdrawal from membership does not relieve a member of liability to the credit union, and we may demand immediate repayment of the money you owe to us after expulsion, subject to any applicable contract terms and conditions. </p>

</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">I—Goals of NCUA Chartering Policy </p>
<p>The National Credit Union Administration's (NCUA) chartering and field of membership policies are directed toward achieving the following goals: </p>
<p>• To encourage the formation of credit unions; </p>
<p>• To uphold the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act;<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-B-to-Part-701-footnote-92" id="Appendix-B-to-Part-701-footref-92">92</a>] </sup>  </p>

<p>• To promote thrift and credit extension; </p>
<p>• To promote credit union safety and soundness; and </p>
<p>• To make quality credit union service available to all eligible persons. </p>
<p>NCUA may grant a charter to single occupational/associational groups, multiple groups, or communities if: </p>
<p>• The occupational, associational, or multiple groups possess an appropriate common bond or the community represents a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district; </p>
<p>• The subscribers are of good character and are fit to represent the proposed credit union; and </p>
<p>• The establishment of the credit union is economically advisable. </p>
<p>Generally, these are the primary criteria that NCUA will consider. In unusual circumstances, however, NCUA may examine other factors, such as other federal law or public policy, in deciding if a charter should be approved. </p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted, the policies outlined in this manual apply only to federal credit unions. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">II—Types of Charters </p>
<p>The Federal Credit Union Act recognizes three types of federal credit union charters— single common bond (occupational and associational), multiple common bond (more than one group each having a common bond of occupation or association), and community. </p>
<p>The requirements that must be met to charter a federal credit union are described in Chapter 2. Special rules for credit unions serving low-income groups are described in Chapter 3. </p>
<p>If a federal credit union charter is granted, Section 5 of the charter will describe the credit union's field of membership, which defines those persons and entities eligible for membership. Generally, federal credit unions are only able to grant loans and provide services to persons within the field of membership who have become members of the credit union. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">III—Subscribers </p>
<p>Federal credit unions are generally organized by persons who volunteer their time and resources and are responsible for determining the interest, commitment, and economic advisability of forming a federal credit union. The organization of a successful federal credit union takes considerable planning and dedication. </p>
<p>Persons interested in organizing a Federal credit union should contact one of the credit union trade associations or the NCUA Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion. Lists of NCUA offices and credit union trade associations are shown in the appendices. NCUA will provide information to groups interested in pursuing a federal charter and will assist them in contacting an organizer. </p>
<p>While anyone may organize a credit union, a person with training and experience in chartering new federal credit unions is generally the most effective organizer. However, extensive involvement by the group desiring credit union service is essential. </p>
<p>The functions of the organizer are to provide direction, guidance, and advice on the chartering process. The organizer also provides the group with information about a credit union's functions and purpose as well as technical assistance in preparing and submitting the charter application. Close communication and cooperation between the organizer and the proposed members are critical to the chartering process. </p>
<p>The Federal Credit Union Act requires that seven or more natural persons—the “subscribers”—present to NCUA for approval a sworn organization certificate stating at a minimum: </p>
<p>• The name of the proposed federal credit union; </p>
<p>• The location of the proposed federal credit union and the territory in which it will operate; </p>
<p>• The names and addresses of the subscribers to the certificate and the number of shares subscribed by each; </p>
<p>• The initial par value of the shares; </p>
<p>• The detailed proposed field of membership; and </p>
<p>• The fact that the certificate is made to enable such persons to avail themselves of the advantages of the Federal Credit Union Act. </p>
<p>Willfully and knowingly making false statements on any of the required documentation filed in obtaining a federal credit union charter may be grounds for federal criminal prosecution under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/18/1001" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">18 U.S.C. 1001</a>. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">IV—Economic Advisability </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.A—General </p>
<p>Before chartering a federal credit union, NCUA must be satisfied that the institution will be viable and that it will provide needed services to its members. Economic advisability, which is a key factor in determining whether a potential charter will have a reasonable opportunity to succeed, is essential in order to qualify for a credit union charter. </p>
<p>NCUA will conduct an independent on-site investigation of each charter application to ensure that the proposed credit union can be successful. In general, the success of any credit union depends on: (a) The character and fitness of management; (b) the depth of the members' support; and (c) present and projected market conditions. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.B—Proposed Management's Character and Fitness </p>
<p>The Federal Credit Union Act requires NCUA to ensure that the subscribers are of good “general character and fitness.” Prospective officials and employees will be the subject of credit and background investigations. The investigation report must demonstrate each applicant's ability to effectively handle financial matters. Employees and officials should also be competent, experienced, honest and of good character. Factors that may lead to disapproval of a prospective official or employee include criminal convictions, indictments, and acts of fraud and dishonesty. Further, factors such as serious or unresolved past due credit obligations and bankruptcies disclosed during credit checks may disqualify an individual. </p>
<p>NCUA also needs reasonable assurance that the management team will have the requisite skills—particularly in leadership and accounting—and the commitment to dedicate the time and effort needed to make the proposed federal credit union a success. </p>
<p>Section 701.14 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations sets forth the procedures for NCUA approval of officials of newly chartered credit unions. If the application of a prospective official or employee to serve is not acceptable to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director, the group can propose an alternate to act in that individual's place. If the charter applicant feels it is essential that the disqualified individual be retained, the individual may appeal the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director's decision to the NCUA Board. If an appeal is pursued, action on the application may be delayed. If the appeal is denied by the NCUA Board, an acceptable new applicant must be provided before the charter can be approved. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.C—Member Support </p>
<p>Economic advisability is a major factor in determining whether the credit union will be chartered. An important consideration is the degree of support from the field of membership. The charter applicant must be able to demonstrate that membership support is sufficient to ensure viability. </p>
<p>NCUA has not set a minimum field of membership size for chartering a federal credit union. Consequently, groups of any size may apply for a credit union charter and be approved if they demonstrate economic advisability. However, it is important to note that often the size of the group is indicative of the potential for success. For that reason, a charter application with fewer than 3,000 primary potential members (<em>e.g.,</em> employees of a corporation or members of an association) may not be economically advisable. Therefore, a charter applicant with a proposed field of membership of fewer than 3,000 primary potential members may have to provide more support than an applicant with a larger field of membership. For example, a small occupational or associational group may be required to demonstrate a commitment for long-term support from the sponsor. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.D—Present and Future Market Conditions—Business Plan </p>
<p>The ability to provide effective service to members, to compete in the marketplace, and to adapt to changing market conditions are key to the survival of any enterprise. Before NCUA will charter a credit union, a business plan based on realistic and supportable projections and assumptions must be submitted. </p>
<p>The business plan should contain, at a minimum, the following elements: </p>
<p>• Mission statement; </p>
<p>• Analysis of market conditions, including if applicable, geographic, demographic, employment, income, housing, and other economic data; </p>
<p>• Evidence of member support; </p>
<p>• Goals for shares, loans, and for number of members; </p>
<p>• Financial services needed/desired; </p>
<p>• Financial services to be provided to members of all segments within the field of membership; </p>
<p>• How/when services are to be implemented; </p>
<p>• Organizational/management plan addressing qualification and planned training of officials/employees; </p>
<p>• Continuity plan for directors, committee members and management staff; </p>
<p>• Operating facilities, to include office space/equipment and supplies, safeguarding of assets, insurance coverage, etc.; </p>
<p>• Type of record-keeping and data processing system; </p>
<p>• Detailed semiannual pro forma financial statements (balance sheet, income and expense projections) for 1st and 2nd year, including assumptions—<em>e.g.,</em> loan and dividend rates; </p>
<p>• Plans for operating independently; </p>
<p>• Written policies (shares, lending, investments, funds management, capital accumulation, dividends, collections, etc.); </p>
<p>• Source of funds to pay expenses during initial months of operation, including any subsidies, assistance, etc., and terms or conditions of such resources; and </p>
<p>• Evidence of sponsor commitment (or other source of support) if subsidies are critical to success of the federal credit union. Evidence may be in the form of letters, contracts, financial statements from the sponsor, and any other such document on which the proposed federal credit union can substantiate its projections. </p>
<p>While the business plan may be prepared with outside assistance, the subscribers and proposed officials must understand and support the submitted business plan. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V—Steps in Organizing a Federal Credit Union </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A—Getting Started </p>
<p>Following the guidance contained throughout this policy, the organizers should submit wording for the proposed field of membership (the persons, organizations and other legal entities the credit union will serve) to NCUA early in the application process for written preliminary approval. The proposed field of membership must meet all common bond or community requirements. </p>
<p>Once the field of membership has been given preliminary approval, the organizer should conduct an organizational meeting to elect seven to ten persons to serve as subscribers. The subscribers should locate willing individuals capable of serving on the board of directors, credit committee, supervisory committee, and as chief operating officer/manager of the proposed credit union. </p>
<p>Subsequent organizational meetings may be held to discuss the progress of the charter investigation, to announce the proposed slate of officials, and to respond to any questions posed at these meetings. </p>
<p>If NCUA approves the charter application, the subscribers, as their final duty, will elect the board of directors of the proposed federal credit union. The new board of directors will then appoint the supervisory committee. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V. B—Charter Application Documentation </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">V.B.1—General </p>
<p>As discussed previously in this Chapter, the organizer of a federal credit union charter must, at a minimum, provide evidence that: </p>
<p>• The group(s) possess an appropriate common bond or the geographical area to be served is a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district; </p>
<p>• The subscribers, prospective officials, and employees are of good character and fitness; and </p>
<p>• The establishment of the credit union is economically advisable. </p>
<p>As part of the application process, the organizer must submit the following forms, which are available in appendix 4 of this Manual: </p>
<p>• Federal Credit Union Investigation Report, NCUA 4001; </p>
<p>• Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008; </p>
<p>• Report of Official and Agreement To Serve, NCUA 4012; </p>
<p>• Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts, NCUA 9500; and </p>
<p>• Certification of Resolutions, NCUA 9501. </p>
<p>Each of these forms is described in more detail in the following sections. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">V.B.2—Federal Credit Union Investigation Report, NCUA 4001 </p>
<p>The application for a new federal credit union will be submitted on NCUA 4001. State-chartered credit unions applying for conversion to a federal charter will use NCUA 4000. (See Chapter 4 for a full discussion.) The organizer is required to certify the information and recommend approval or disapproval, based on the investigation of the request. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">V.B.3—Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008 </p>
<p>This document, which must be completed by the subscribers, includes the seven criteria established by the Federal Credit Union Act. NCUA staff assigned to the case will assist in the proper completion of this document. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">V.B.4—Report of Official and Agreement To Serve, NCUA 4012 </p>
<p>This form documents general background information of each official and employee of the proposed federal credit union. Each official and employee must complete and sign this form. The organizer must review each of the NCUA 4012s for elements that would prevent the prospective official or employee from serving. Further, such factors as serious, unresolved past due credit obligations and bankruptcies disclosed during credit checks may disqualify an individual. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">V.B.5—Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts, NCUA 9500 </p>
<p>This document contains the agreements with which federal credit unions must comply in order to obtain National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) coverage of member accounts. The document must be completed and signed by both the chief executive officer and chief financial officer. A federal credit union must qualify for federal share insurance. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">V.B.6—Certification of Resolutions, NCUA 9501 </p>
<p>This document certifies that the board of directors of the proposed federal credit union has resolved to apply for NCUSIF insurance of member accounts and has authorized the chief executive officer and recording officer to execute the Application and Agreements for Insurance of Accounts. Both the chief executive officer and recording officer of the proposed federal credit union must sign this form. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">VI—Name Selection </p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the federal credit union organizers or officials of an existing credit union to ensure that the proposed federal credit union name or federal credit union name change does not constitute an infringement on the name of any corporation in its trade area. This responsibility also includes researching any service marks or trademarks used by any other corporation (including credit unions) in its trade area. NCUA will ensure, to the extent possible, that the credit union's name: </p>
<p>• Is not already being officially used by another federal credit union; </p>
<p>• Will not be confused with NCUA or another federal or state agency, or with another credit union; and </p>
<p>• Does not include misleading or inappropriate language. </p>
<p>The last three words in the name of every credit union chartered by NCUA must be “Federal Credit Union.” </p>
<p>The word “community,” while not required, can only be included in the name of federal credit unions that have been granted a community charter. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">VII—NCUA Review </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">VII.A—General </p>
<p>Once NCUA receives a complete charter application package, an acknowledgment of receipt will be sent to the organizer. During the review process, a staff member will be assigned to perform an on-site contact with the proposed officials and others having an interest in the proposed federal credit union. </p>
<p>NCUA staff will review the application package and verify its accuracy and reasonableness. A staff member will inquire into the financial management experience and the suitability and commitment of the proposed officials and employees, and will make an assessment of economic advisability. The staff member will also provide guidance to the subscribers in the proper completion of the Organization Certificate, NCUA 4008. </p>
<p>Credit and background investigations may be conducted concurrently by NCUA with other work being performed by the organizer and subscribers to reduce the likelihood of delays in the chartering process. </p>
<p>The staff member will analyze the prospective credit union's business plan for realistic projections, attainable goals, adequate service to all segments of the field of membership, sufficient start-up capital, and time commitment by the proposed officials and employees. Any concerns will be reviewed with the organizer and discussed with the prospective credit union's officials. Additional on-site contacts by NCUA staff may be necessary. The organizer and subscribers will be expected to take the steps necessary to resolve any issues or concerns. Such resolution efforts may delay processing the application. </p>
<p>NCUA staff will then make a recommendation to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director regarding the charter application. The recommendation may include specific provisions to be included in a Letter of Understanding and Agreement. In most cases, NCUA will require the prospective officials to adhere to certain operational guidelines. Generally, the agreement is for a limited term of two to four years. A sample Letter of Understanding and Agreement is found in appendix 2. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">VII.B—Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Approval </p>
<p>Once approved, the board of directors of the newly formed federal credit union will receive a signed charter and standard bylaws from the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. Additionally, the officials will be advised of the name of the examiner assigned responsibility for supervising and examining the credit union. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">VII.C—Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Disapproval </p>
<p>When the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director disapproves any charter application, in whole or in part, the organizer will be informed in writing of the specific reasons for the disapproval. Where applicable, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will provide information concerning options or suggestions that the applicant could consider for gaining approval or otherwise acquiring credit union service. The letter of denial will include the procedures for appealing the decision. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">VII.D—Appeal of Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision </p>
<p>If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director denies a charter application, in whole or in part, that decision may be appealed to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-746" class="cfr external">part 746 of this chapter</a>. </p>
<p>Before appealing, the prospective group may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration should contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">VII.E—Commencement of Operations </p>
<p>Assistance in commencing operations is generally available through the various credit union trade organizations listed in appendix 5. </p>
<p>All new federal credit unions are also encouraged to establish a mentor relationship with a knowledgeable, experienced credit union individual or an existing, well-operated credit union. The mentor should provide guidance and assistance to the new credit union through attendance at meetings and general oversight. Upon request, NCUA will provide assistance in finding a qualified mentor. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">VIII—Future Supervision </p>
<p>Each federal credit union will be examined regularly by NCUA to determine that it remains in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to determine that it does not pose undue risk to the NCUSIF. The examiner will contact the credit union officials shortly after approval of the charter in order to arrange for the initial examination (usually within the first six months of operation). </p>
<p>The examiner will be responsible for monitoring the progress of the credit union and providing the necessary advice and guidance to ensure it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The examiner will also monitor compliance with the terms of any required Letter of Understanding and Agreement. Typically, the examiner will require the credit union to submit copies of monthly board minutes and financial statements. </p>
<p>The Federal Credit Union Act requires all newly chartered credit unions, up to two years after the charter anniversary date, to obtain NCUA approval prior to appointment of any new board member, credit or supervisory committee member, or senior executive officer. Section 701.14 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations sets forth the notice and application requirements. If NCUA issues a Notice of Disapproval, the newly chartered credit union is prohibited from making the change. </p>
<p>NCUA may disapprove an individual serving as a director, committee member or senior executive officer if it finds that the competence, experience, character, or integrity of the individual indicates it would not be in the best interests of the members of the credit union or of the public to permit the individual to be employed by or associated with the credit union. If a Notice of Disapproval is issued, the credit union may appeal the decision to the NCUA Board. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(I.)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 I.">I. A.1—General </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">As set forth in Chapter 1, the Federal Credit Union Act provides for three types of federal credit union charters—single common bond (occupational or associational), multiple common bond (multiple groups), and community. Section 109 (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1759" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1759</a>) of the Federal Credit Union Act addresses the membership requirements for each type of charter. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The field of membership, which is specified in Section 5 of the charter, defines those persons and entities eligible for membership. A single common bond federal credit union consists of one group having a common bond of occupation or association. A multiple common bond federal credit union consists of more than one group, each of which has a common bond of occupation or association. A community federal credit union consists of persons or organizations within a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Once chartered, a federal credit union can amend its field of membership; however, the same common bond or community requirements for chartering the credit union must be satisfied. Since there are differences in the three types of charters, special rules apply to each, which are fully discussed in the following sections of this Chapter. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">I.A.2—Special Low-Income Rules </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Generally, federal credit unions can only grant loans and provide services to persons who have joined the credit union. The Federal Credit Union Act states that one of the purposes of federal credit unions is “to serve the productive and provident credit needs of individuals of modest means.” Although field of membership requirements are applicable, special rules set forth in Chapter 3 may apply to low-income designated credit unions and those credit unions assisting low-income groups or to a federal credit union that adds an underserved community to its field of membership. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A single occupational common bond federal credit union may include in its field of membership all persons and entities who share that common bond. NCUA permits a person's membership eligibility in a single occupational common bond group to be established in five ways: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employment (or a contractual relationship equivalent to employment) in a single corporation or other legal entity makes that person part of a single occupational common bond; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employment in a corporation or other legal entity with a controlling ownership interest (which shall not be less than 10 percent) in or by another legal entity makes that person part of a single occupational common bond; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employment in a corporation or other legal entity which is related to another legal entity (such as a company under contract and possessing a strong dependency relationship with another company) makes that person part of a single occupational common bond; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employment or attendance at a school makes that person part of a single occupational common bond (see Chapter 2, Section III.A.1); or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employment in the same Trade, Industry, or Profession (TIP) (see Chapter 2, Section II.A.2). </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A geographic limitation is not a requirement for a single occupational common bond. However, for purposes of describing the field of membership, the geographic areas being served may be included in the charter. For example: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees, officials, and persons who work regularly under contract in Miami, Florida for ABC Corporation and subsidiaries; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of ABC Corporation who are paid from * * *; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of ABC Corporation who are supervised from * * *; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of ABC Corporation who are headquartered in * * *; and/or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of ABC Corporation who work in the United States. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The corporation or other legal entity (<em>i.e.,</em> the employer) may also be included in the common bond—<em>e.g.,</em> “ABC Corporation.” The corporation or legal entity will be defined in the last clause in Section 5 of the credit union's charter. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A charter applicant must provide documentation to establish that the single occupational common bond requirement has been met. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Some examples of valid single occupational common bonds are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of the Hunt Manufacturing Company who work in West Chester, Pennsylvania. (common bond—same employer with geographic definition); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of the Buffalo Manufacturing Company who work in the United States. (common bond—same employer with geographic definition); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees, elected and appointed officials of municipal government in Parma, Ohio. (common bond—same employer with geographic definition); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of Johnson Soap Company and its majority owned subsidiary, Johnson Toothpaste Company, who work in, are paid from, are supervised from, or are headquartered in Augusta and Portland, Maine. (common bond—parent and subsidiary company with geographic definition); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of MMLLJS contractor who work regularly at the U.S. Naval Shipyard in Bremerton, Washington. (common bond—employees of contractors with geographic definition); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees, doctors, medical staff, technicians, medical and nursing students who work in or are paid from the Newport Beach Medical Center, Newport Beach, California. (single corporation with geographic definition); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of JLS, Incorporated and MJM, Incorporated working for the LKM Joint Venture Company in Catalina Island, California. (common bond—same employer—ongoing dependent relationship); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of and students attending Georgetown University. (common bond—same occupation); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of all the schools supervised by the Timbrook Board of Education in Timbrook, Georgia. (common bond—same employer); or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• All licensed nurses in Fairfax County, Virginia. (occupational common bond TIP). </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In contrast, some examples of insufficiently defined single occupational common bonds are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of manufacturing firms in Seattle, Washington. (no defined occupational sponsor; overly broad TIP); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons employed or working in Chicago, Illinois. (no occupational common bond). </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.A.2—Trade, Industry, or Profession </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A common bond based on employment in a trade, industry, or profession can include employment at any number of corporations or other legal entities that—while not under common ownership—have a common bond by virtue of producing similar products, providing similar services, or participating in the same type of business. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">While proposed or existing single common bond credit unions have some latitude in defining a trade, industry, or profession occupational common bond, it cannot be defined so broadly as to include groups in fields which are not closely related. For example, the manufacturing industry, energy industry, communications industry, retail industry, or entertainment industry would not qualify as a TIP because each industry lacks the necessary commonality. However, textile workers, realtors, nurses, teachers, police officers, or U.S. military personnel are closely related and each would qualify as a TIP. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The common bond relationship must be one that demonstrates a narrow commonality of interests within a specific trade, industry, or profession. If a credit union wants to serve a physician TIP, it can serve all physicians, but that does not mean it can also serve all clerical staff in the physicians' offices. However, if the TIP is based on the health care industry, then clerical staff would be able to be served by the credit union because they work in the same industry and have the same commonality of interests. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If a credit union wants to include the airline services industry, it can serve airline and airport personnel but not passengers. Clients or customers of the TIP are not eligible for credit union membership (<em>e.g.,</em> patients in hospitals). Any company that is involved in more than one industry cannot be included in an industry TIP (<em>e.g.,</em> a company that makes tobacco products, food products, and electronics). However, employees of these companies may be eligible for membership in a variety of trade/profession occupational common bond TIPs. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Although a TIP should be narrowly defined, and ordinarily would not include third-party vendors and other suppliers, it may include, on a case by case basis, employees of types of entities that have a “strong dependency relationship” and work directly with other types of entities within the industry. In this context, a “strong dependency relationship” between a TIP entity and its supplier/vendor must be demonstrated by their reliance on each other as measured by the presence of indicators of a likelihood that the absence of one would cause the other to suffer a material decline in either revenue, functionality or productivity. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Under this definition, a firm whose employees are specially trained to protect nuclear facilities, and whose employees work primarily at such facilities, could be a part of a TIP based on the firm's participation in the nuclear energy industry. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Other “strong relationship” indicators NCUA would consider include the regularity or frequency of work that employees of the entity perform at facilities directly related to the industry, or the degree to which employees must adjust their work practices to adapt to the needs of the industry. For example, a company's focus on producing specialized confectionary products for a hotel chain could add that company to a hospitality industry TIP. A credit union seeking to include a clause of this type in its TIP charter must provide a brief narrative identifying indicators that support the existence of a strong dependency relationship between the TIP entity and its individual supplier/vendors. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Likewise, an FCU may serve employees of companies within the commercial airline industry that have a strong dependency relationship with airlines or airports, without the limitation that these employees work at an airport. However, these employees must work directly with the following: Air transportation of freight, air courier services; air passenger services; airport baggage handling; airport security; commercial airport janitorial services; maintenance, servicing, and repair services; and on board airline food services. The employees of those entities have a narrow commonality of interests, share the single occupational common bond, and can be included within the Air Transportation Industry field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In general, except for credit unions serving a national field of membership or operating in multiple states, a geographic limitation is required for a TIP credit union. The geographic limitation will be part of the credit union's charter and generally correspond to its current or planned operational area. More than one federal credit union may serve the same trade, industry, or profession, even if both credit unions are in the same geographic location. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">This type of occupational common bond is only available to single common bond credit unions. A TIP cannot be added to a multiple common bond or community field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">To obtain a TIP designation, the proposed or existing credit union must submit a request to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. New charter applicants must follow the documentation requirements in Chapter 1. New charter applicants and existing credit unions must submit a business plan on how the credit union will serve the group with the request to serve the TIP. The business plan also must address how the credit union will verify the TIP. Examples of such verification include state licenses, professional licenses, organizational memberships, pay statements, union membership, or employer certification. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director must approve this type of field of membership before a credit union can serve a TIP. Credit unions converting to a TIP can retain members of record but cannot add new members from its previous group or groups, unless the group or groups are part of the TIP. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section II.B on Occupational Common Bond Amendments does not apply to a TIP common bond. Removing or changing a geographical limitation will be processed as a housekeeping amendment. If safety and soundness concerns are present, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may require additional information before the request can be processed. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section II.H, on Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership, applies to TIP based credit unions except for the corporate account provision which only applies to industry based TIPs. Credit unions with industry based TIPs may include corporations as members because they have the same commonality of interests as all employees in the industry. For example, an airline service TIP (industry) can serve an airline carrier (corporate account); however, a nurses TIP (profession) could not serve a hospital (corporate account) because not everyone working in the hospital shares the same profession. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If a TIP designated credit union wishes to convert to a different TIP or employer-based occupational common bond, or different charter type, it only retains members of record after the conversion. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director, for safety and soundness reasons, may approve a TIP designated credit union to convert to its original field of membership. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section 5 of every single occupational federal credit union's charter defines the field of membership the credit union can legally serve. Only those persons or legal entities specified in the field of membership can be served. There are a number of instances in which Section 5 must be amended by NCUA. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">First, a group sharing the credit union's common bond is added to the field of membership. This may occur through various ways including agreement between the group and the credit union directly, or through a merger, corporate acquisition, purchase and assumption (P&amp;A), or spin-off. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Second, if the entire field of membership is acquired by another corporation, the credit union can serve the employees of the new corporation and any subsidiaries after receiving NCUA approval. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Third, a federal credit union qualifies to change its common bond from: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A single occupational common bond to a single associational common bond; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A single occupational common bond to a community charter; or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A single occupational common bond to a multiple common bond. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Fourth, a federal credit union removes a portion of the group from its field of membership through agreement with the group, a spin-off, or because a portion of the group is no longer in existence. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An existing single occupational common bond federal credit union that submits a request to amend its charter must provide documentation to establish that the occupational common bond requirement has been met. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director must approve all amendments to an occupational common bond credit union's field of membership. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.B.2—Restructuring </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the single common bond group that comprises a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, the result is often that portions of the group are sold or spun off. This requires a change to the credit union's field of membership. NCUA will not permit a single common bond credit union to maintain in its field of membership a sold or spun-off group to which it has been providing service unless the group otherwise qualifies for membership in the credit union or the credit union converts to a multiple common bond credit union. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the group comprising the single common bond of the credit union merges with, or is acquired by, another group, the credit union can serve the new group resulting from the merger or acquisition after receiving a housekeeping amendment. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.B.3—Economic Advisability </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Prior to granting a common bond expansion, NCUA will examine the amendment's likely effect on the credit union's operations and financial condition. In most cases, the information needed for analyzing the effect of adding a particular group will be available to NCUA through the examination and financial and statistical reports; however, in particular cases, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may require additional information prior to making a decision. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.B.4—Documentation Requirements </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union requesting a common bond expansion must submit an Application for Field of Membership Amendment (NCUA 4015–EZ) to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. An authorized credit union representative must sign the request. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Before acting on a proposed amendment, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may require an on-site review. In addition, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may, after taking into account the significance of the proposed field of membership amendment, require the applicant to submit a business plan addressing specific issues. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. NCUA will carefully consider the economic advisability of expanding the field of membership of a credit union with financial or operational problems. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In most cases, field of membership amendments will only be approved for credit unions that are operating satisfactorily. Generally, if a federal credit union is having difficulty providing service to its current membership, or is experiencing financial or other operational problems, it may have more difficulty serving an expanded field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Occasionally, however, an expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing current financial problems. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's financial or operational problems.

<p>In general, other than the addition of common bond groups, there are three additional ways a federal credit union with a single occupational common bond can expand its field of membership: </p>
<p>• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency merger; </p>
<p>• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency purchase and assumption (P&amp;A); or </p>
<p>• By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a common bond spin-off. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(II.)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 II.">II. D.1—Mergers </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions found in this chapter apply to mergers where the continuing credit union has a federal charter. That is, the two credit unions must share a common bond. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Where the merging credit union is state-chartered, the common bond rules applicable to a federal credit union apply. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If a single occupational credit union wants to merge into a multiple common bond or community credit union, Section IV.D or Section V.D of this Chapter, respectively, should be reviewed. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.D.2—Emergency Mergers </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• An emergency requiring expeditious action exists; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The public interest would best be served by approving the merger. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Abandonment by management; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Loss of sponsor; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Serious and persistent recordkeeping problems; or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Serious and persistent operational concerns. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any common bond restrictions. Under this authority, therefore, a single occupational common bond federal credit union may take into its field of membership any dissimilar charter type. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The common bond characteristic of the continuing credit union in an emergency merger does not change. That is, even though the merging credit union is a multiple common bond or community, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Similarly, if the merging credit union is also an unlike single common bond, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Future common bond expansions will be based on the continuing credit union's original single common bond. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA field regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.D.3—Purchase and Assumption (P&amp;A) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&amp;A. A P&amp;A has limited application because, in most cases, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. In the few instances where a P&amp;A may be appropriate, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency merger criteria are satisfied. However, if the P&amp;A does not meet the emergency merger criteria, it must be processed under the common bond requirements. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In a P&amp;A processed under the emergency criteria, specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities, without regard to common bond restrictions, may also be acquired without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the purchased and/or assumed credit union's field of membership does not share a common bond with the purchasing and/or assuming credit union, then the continuing credit union's original common bond will be controlling for future common bond expansions. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">P&amp;As involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.D.4—Spin-Offs </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">All common bond requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group becomes a new credit union or goes to an existing federal charter. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Why the spin-off is being requested; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• What part of the field of membership is to be spun off; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Whether the affected credit unions have a common bond (applies only to single occupational credit unions); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The proposed spin-off date; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off—those whose shares are to be transferred—are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Spin-offs involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all regional directors and, if applicable, Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the credit unions are headquartered and the state regulators, as applicable. Spin-offs in the same region also require approval by the state regulator, as applicable. Spin-offs involving the creation of a new federally insured credit union require the approval of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion also provides advice regarding field of membership compatibility when appropriate. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions. NCUA will permit single occupational federal credit unions to overlap any other charter without performing an overlap analysis. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.E.2—Organizational Restructuring </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the common bond descriptions contained in Section 5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of the common bond described in Section 5. NCUA will permit a complete overlap of the credit unions' fields of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If a sponsor organization sells off a group, new members can no longer be served unless they otherwise qualify for membership in the credit union or it converts to a multiple common bond charter. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Credit unions must submit documentation explaining the restructuring and providing information regarding the new organizational structure. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.E.3—Exclusionary Clauses </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new Chartering and Field of Membership Manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">II.F—Charter Conversion </p>
<p>A single occupational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter provided the field of membership requirements of the community charter are met. Groups within the existing charter which cannot qualify in the new charter cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&amp;A. A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion. Members of record can continue to be served. Also, in order to support a case for a conversion, the applicant federal credit union may be required to develop a detailed business plan as specified in Chapter 2, Section V.A.3. </p>
<p>A single occupational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a multiple common bond charter by adding a non-common bond group that is within a reasonable proximity of a service facility. Groups within the existing charter may be retained and continue to be served. However, future amendments, including any expansions of the original single common bond group, must be done in accordance with multiple common bond policy. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(II.)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 II.">II. G—Removal of Groups From the Field of Membership </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A credit union may request removal of a portion of the common bond group from its field of membership for various reasons. The most common reasons for this type of amendment are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group is within the field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group has ceased to exist; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support; or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group initiates action to be removed from the field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will determine why the credit union desires to remove the group. If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director concurs with the request, membership will continue for those who are already members under the “once a member, always a member” provision of the Federal Credit Union Act. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">II.H—Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership </p>
<p>A number of persons, by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group, may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following: </p>
<p>• Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Employees of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment; </p>
<p>• Volunteers; </p>
<p>• Members of the immediate family or household; </p>
<p>• Honorably discharged veterans who served in any of the Armed Services of the United States listed in this charter; </p>
<p>Organizations of such persons; and </p>
<p>• Corporate or other legal entities in this charter. </p>
<p>Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships. </p>
<p>Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit. </p>
<p>Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an “immediate family or household” of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household. </p>
<p>Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. Examples include volunteers working at a hospital or school. </p>
<p>Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as “once a member, always a member.” The “once a member, always a member” provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A single associational federal credit union may include in its field of membership, regardless of location, all members and employees of a recognized association. A single associational common bond consists of individuals (natural persons) and/or groups (non-natural persons) whose members participate in activities developing common loyalties, mutual benefits, and mutual interests. Separately chartered associational groups can establish a single common bond relationship if they are integrally related and share common goals and purposes. For example, two or more churches of the same denomination, Knights of Columbus Councils, or locals of the same union can qualify as a single associational common bond. Individuals and groups eligible for membership in a single associational credit union can include the following: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Natural person members of the association (for example, members of a union or church members); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Non-natural person members of the association; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Employees of the association (for example, employees of the labor union or employees of the church); and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The association. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Generally, a single associational common bond does not include a geographic definition and can operate nationally. However, a proposed or existing federal credit union may limit its field of membership to a single association or geographic area. NCUA may impose a geographic limitation if it is determined that the applicant credit union does not have the ability to serve a larger group or there are other operational concerns. All single associational common bonds should include a definition of the group that may be served based on the association's charter, bylaws, and any other equivalent documentation. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Applicants for a single associational common bond federal credit union charter or a field of membership amendment to include an association must provide, at the request of NCUA, a copy of the association's charter, bylaws, or other equivalent documentation, including any legal documents required by the state or other governing authority. The associational sponsor itself may also be included in the field of membership—<em>e.g.,</em> “Sprocket Association”—and will be shown in the last clause of the field of membership. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">III.A.1.a—Threshold Requirement Regarding the Purpose for Which an Associational Group Is Formed and the Totality of the Circumstances Criteria </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">As a threshold matter, when reviewing an application to include an association in a federal credit union's field of membership, NCUA will determine if the association has been formed primarily for the purpose of expanding credit union membership. If NCUA makes such a determination, then the analysis ends and the association is denied inclusion in the federal credit union's field of membership. If NCUA determines that the association was formed to serve some other separate function as an organization, then NCUA will apply the following totality of the circumstances test to determine if the association satisfies the associational common bond requirements.

<p class="hd3-paragraph">III.A.1.c—Additional Information </p>
<p>A support group whose members are continually changing or whose duration is temporary may not meet the single associational common bond criteria. Each class of member will be evaluated based on the totality of the circumstances. Individuals or honorary members who only make donations to the association are not eligible to join the credit union. </p>
<p>Student groups (<em>e.g.,</em> students enrolled at a public, private, or parochial school) may constitute either an associational or occupational common bond. For example, students enrolled at a church sponsored school could share a single associational common bond with the members of that church and may qualify for a federal credit union charter. Similarly, students enrolled at a university, as a group by itself, or in conjunction with the faculty and employees of the school, could share a single occupational common bond and may qualify for a federal credit union charter. </p>
<p>Tenant groups, consumer groups, and other groups of persons having an “interest in” a particular cause and certain consumer cooperatives may also qualify as an association. </p>
<p>Associations based primarily on a client-customer relationship do not meet associational common bond requirements. Health clubs are an example of a group not meeting associational common bond requirements, including YMCAs. However, having an incidental client-customer relationship does not preclude an associational charter as long as the associational common bond requirements are met. For example, a fraternal association that offers insurance, which is not a condition of membership, may qualify as a valid associational common bond. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.A.2—Subsequent Changes to Association's Bylaws </p>
<p>If the association's membership or geographical definitions in its charter and bylaws are changed subsequent to the effective date stated in the field of membership, the credit union must submit the revised charter or bylaws for NCUA's consideration and approval prior to serving members of the association added as a result of the change. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.A.3—Sample Single Associational Common Bonds </p>
<p>Some examples of associational common bonds are: </p>
<p>• Regular members of Locals 10 and 13, IBEW, in Florida, who qualify for membership in accordance with their charter and bylaws in effect on May 20, 2001; </p>
<p>• Members of the Hoosier Farm Bureau in Grant, Logan, or Lee Counties of Indiana, who qualify for membership in accordance with its charter and bylaws in effect on March 7, 1997; </p>
<p>• Members of the Shalom Congregation in Chevy Chase, Maryland; </p>
<p>• Regular members of the Corporate Executives Association, located in Westchester, New York, who qualify for membership in accordance with its charter and bylaws in effect on December 1, 1997; </p>
<p>• Members of the University of Wisconsin Alumni Association, located in Green Bay, Wisconsin; </p>
<p>• Members of the Marine Corps Reserve Officers Association; or </p>
<p>• Members of St. John's Methodist Church and St. Luke's Methodist Church, located in Toledo, Ohio. </p>
<p>Some examples of insufficiently defined single associational common bonds are: </p>
<p>• All Lutherans in the United States (too broadly defined); or </p>
<p>• Veterans of U.S. military service (group is too broadly defined; no formal association of all members of the group). </p>
<p>Some examples of unacceptable single associational common bonds are: </p>
<p>• Alumni of Amos University (no formal association); </p>
<p>• Customers of Fleetwood Insurance Company (policyholders or primarily customer/client relationships do not meet associational standards); </p>
<p>• Employees of members of the Reston, Virginia, Chamber of Commerce (not a sufficiently close tie to the associational common bond); or </p>
<p>• Members of St. John's Lutheran Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church located in Anniston, Alabama (churches are not of the same denomination). </p>

There are three instances in which Section 5 must be amended by NCUA. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">First, a group that shares the credit union's common bond is added to the field of membership.

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Second, a federal credit union qualifies to change its common bond from: </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An existing single associational federal credit union that submits a request to amend its charter must provide documentation to establish that the associational common bond requirement has been met.

<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.B.2—Organizational Restructuring </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the single common bond group that comprises a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, the result is often that portions of the group are sold or spun off. This is an event requiring a change to the credit union's field of membership. NCUA may not permit a single associational credit union to maintain in its field of membership a sold or spun-off group to which it has been providing service unless the group otherwise qualifies for membership in the credit union or the credit union converts to a multiple common bond credit union. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the group comprising the single common bond of the credit union merges with, or is acquired by, another group, the credit union can serve the new group resulting from the merger or acquisition after receiving a housekeeping amendment. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.B.3—Economic Advisability </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Prior to granting a common bond expansion, NCUA will examine the amendment's likely impact on the credit union's operations and financial condition. In most cases, the information needed for analyzing the effect of adding a particular group will be available to NCUA through the examination and financial and statistical reports; however, in particular cases, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may require additional information prior to making a decision. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.B.4—Documentation Requirements </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union requesting a common bond expansion must submit an Application for Field of Membership Amendment (NCUA 4015–EZ) to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. An authorized credit union representative must sign the request. </p>

<p>In general, other than the addition of common bond groups, there are three additional ways a federal credit union with a single associational common bond can expand its field of membership: </p>
<p>• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency merger; </p>
<p>• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a common bond or emergency purchase and assumption (P&amp;A); or </p>
<p>• By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a common bond spin-off. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(III.)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 III.">III. D.1—Mergers </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions found in this section apply to mergers where the continuing credit union is a federal charter. That is, the two credit unions must share a common bond. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Where the merging credit union is state-chartered, the common bond rules applicable to a federal credit union apply. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If a single associational credit union wants to merge into a multiple common bond or community credit union, Section IV.D or Section V.D of this Chapter, respectively, should be reviewed. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.D.2—Emergency Mergers </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• An emergency requiring expeditious action exists; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The public interest would best be served by approving the merger. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Abandonment by management; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Loss of sponsor; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Serious and persistent record-keeping problems; or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Serious and persistent operational concerns. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any common bond restrictions. Under this authority, therefore, a single associational common bond federal credit union may take into its field of membership any dissimilar charter type. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The common bond characteristic of the continuing credit union in an emergency merger does not change. That is, even though the merging credit union is a multiple common bond or community, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Similarly, if the merging credit union is an unlike single common bond, the continuing credit union will remain a single common bond credit union. Future common bond expansions will be based on the continuing credit union's single common bond. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.D.3—Purchase and Assumption (P&amp;A) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&amp;A. A P&amp;A has limited application because, in most cases, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. In the few instances where a P&amp;A may be appropriate, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency merger criteria are satisfied. However, if the P&amp;A does not meet the emergency merger criteria, it must be processed under the common bond requirements. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In a P&amp;A processed under the emergency criteria, specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities, without regard to common bond restrictions, may also be acquired without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the purchased and/or assumed credit union's field of membership does not share a common bond with the purchasing and/or assuming credit union, then the continuing credit union's original common bond will be controlling for future common bond expansions. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">P&amp;As involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.D.4—Spin-Offs </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">All common bond requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group becomes a new credit union or goes to an existing federal charter. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Why the spin-off is being requested; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• What part of the field of membership is to be spun off; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Whether the affected credit unions have the same common bond (applies only to single associational credit unions); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The proposed spin-off date; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off—those whose shares are to be transferred—are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Spin-offs involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all regional directors and, if applicable, Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the credit unions are headquartered and the state regulators, as applicable. Spin-offs in the same region also require approval by the state regulator, as applicable. Spin-offs involving the creation of a new federally insured credit union require the approval of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion also provides advice regarding field of membership compatibility when appropriate. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.E.2—Organizational Restructuring </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union's field of membership will always be governed by the common bond descriptions contained in Section 5 of its charter. Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of the common bond described in Section 5. NCUA will permit a complete overlap of the credit unions' fields of membership. If a sponsor organization sells off a group, new members can no longer be served unless they otherwise qualify for membership in the credit union or it converts to a multiple common bond. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Credit unions must submit documentation explaining the restructuring and providing information regarding the new organizational structure. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.E.3—Exclusionary Clauses </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new Chartering and Field of Membership Manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">III.F—Charter Conversions </p>
<p>A single associational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter provided the field of membership requirements of the community charter are met. Groups within the existing charter which cannot qualify in the new charter cannot be served except for members of record, or groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&amp;A. A credit union must notify all groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of conversion. Members of record can continue to be served. Also, in order to support a case for a conversion, the applicant federal credit union may be required to develop a detailed business plan as specified in Chapter 2, Section V.A.3. </p>
<p>A single associational common bond federal credit union may apply to convert to a multiple common bond charter by adding a non-common bond group that is within a reasonable proximity of a service facility. Groups within the existing charter may be retained and continue to be served. However, future amendments, including any expansions of the original single common bond group, must be done in accordance with multiple common bond policy. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(III.)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 III.">III. G—Removal of Groups From the Field of Membership </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A credit union may request removal of a portion of the common bond group from its field of membership for various reasons. The most common reasons for this type of amendment are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group is within the field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group has ceased to exist; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support; or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group initiates action to be removed from the field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">When a federal credit union requests an amendment to remove a group from its field of membership, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will determine why the credit union desires to remove the group. If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director concurs with the request, membership will continue for those who are already members under the “once a member, always a member” provision of the Federal Credit Union Act. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">III.H—Other Persons Eligible for Credit Union Membership </p>
<p>A number of persons by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following: </p>
<p>• Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Employees of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Volunteers; </p>
<p>• Members of the immediate family or household; </p>
<p>• Honorably discharged veterans who served in any of the Armed Services of the United States in this charter; </p>
<p>Organizations of such persons; and </p>
<p>• Corporate or other legal entities in this charter. </p>
<p>Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships. </p>
<p>Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit. </p>
<p>Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an “immediate family or household” of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household. </p>
<p>Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. One example is volunteers working at a church. </p>
<p>Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as “once a member, always a member.” The “once a member, always a member” provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union may be chartered to serve a combination of distinct, definable single occupational and/or associational common bonds. This type of credit union is called a multiple common bond credit union. Each group in the field of membership must have its own occupational or associational common bond. For example, a multiple common bond credit union may include two unrelated employers, or two unrelated associations, or a combination of two or more employers or associations. Additionally, these groups must be within reasonable geographic proximity of the credit union. That is, the groups must be within the service area of one of the credit union's service facilities. These groups are referred to as select groups. A multiple common bond credit union cannot include a TIP or expand using single common bond criteria. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Employment in a corporation or other legal entity which is related to another legal entity (such as a company under contract to, and possessing a strong dependency relationship with, the other company) makes that person part of the occupational common bond of a select employee group within a multiple common bond. In this context, a “strong dependency relationship” is a relationship in which the entities rely on each other as measured by a pattern of regularly doing business with each other, for example, as documented by the number, the term length, and the dollar volume of prior and pending contracts between them. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A multiple common bond credit union's charter may also combine individual occupational groups that each consist of employees of a retailer or other business tenant of an industrial park, a shopping mall, office park or office building (each “a park”). To be able to have this type of clause in its charter, the multiple common bond credit union first must receive a request from an authorized representative of the group or the park to establish credit union service. The park must be within the multiple common bond credit union's service area, and each occupational group must have fewer than 3,000 employees, who are eligible for membership only for so long as each is employed by a park tenant. Under this clause, a multiple common bond credit union can enroll group employees only while the group's retail or business employer is a park tenant, but such credit unions are free to serve employees of new groups under the above conditions as each respective employer becomes a park tenant. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union's service area is the area that can reasonably be served by the service facilities accessible to the groups within the field of membership. The service area will most often coincide with that geographic area primarily served by the service facility. Additionally, the groups served by the credit union must have access to the service facility. The non-availability of other credit union service is a factor to be considered in determining whether the group is within reasonable proximity of a credit union wishing to add the group to its field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A service facility for multiple common bond credit unions is defined as a place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted, or loans are disbursed. This definition includes a credit union-owned branch, a mobile branch, an office operated on a regularly scheduled weekly basis, a credit union-owned ATM, or a credit union-owned electronic facility that meets, at a minimum, these requirements. A service facility also includes a shared branch or a shared branch network location, including a shared ATM or electronic facility that meets the above requirements, if the credit union participates in a shared branching network. This definition does not include the credit union's internet website. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The select group as a whole will be considered to be within a credit union's service area when: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A majority of the persons in a select group live, work, or gather regularly within the service area; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group's headquarters is located within the service area; or </p>

For such cases NCUA, in its discretion, will accept a written statement indicating these conditions exist as sufficient documentation the group cannot form its own credit union. Groups with 5,000 or more members will be subject to the standard document requirements as discussed later in this chapter, requiring a group to fully describe its inability to establish a new single common bond credit union. </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.B.4—Restructuring </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">If a select group within a federal credit union's field of membership undergoes a substantial restructuring, a change to the credit union's field of membership may be required if the credit union is to continue to provide service to the select group. NCUA permits a multiple common bond credit union to maintain in its field of membership a sold, spun-off, or merged select group to which it has been providing service. This type of amendment to the credit union's charter is not considered an expansion; therefore, the criteria relating to adding new groups are not applicable. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">When two groups merge and each is in the field of membership of a credit union, then both (or all affected) credit unions can serve the resulting merged group, subject to any existing geographic limitation and without regard to any overlap provisions. However, the credit unions cannot serve the other multiple groups that may be in the field of membership of the other credit union. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">A voluntary merger of two or more federal credit unions is permissible as long as each select group in the merging credit union's field of membership has less than 3,000 primary potential members.

If the merging credit union has any other groups consisting of 3,000 or more primary potential members, special requirements apply. NCUA will analyze each group of 3,000 or more primary potential members, except as noted above, to determine whether the formation of a separate credit union by such a group is practical. If the formation of a separate credit union by such a group is not practical because the group lacks sufficient volunteer and other resources to support the efficient and effective operations of a credit union or does not meet the economic advisable criteria outlined in Chapter 1, the group may be merged into a multiple common bond credit union.

<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.D.2—Supervisory Mergers </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The NCUA may approve the merger of any federally insured credit union when safety and soundness concerns are present without regard to the 3,000 numerical limitation. The credit union need not be insolvent or in danger of insolvency for NCUA to use this statutory authority. Examples constituting appropriate reasons for using this authority are: abandonment of the management and/or officials and an inability to find replacements, loss of sponsor support, serious and persistent record-keeping problems, sustained material decline in financial condition, or other serious or persistent circumstances. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.D.3—Emergency Mergers </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• An emergency requiring expeditious action exists; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• The public interest would best be served by approving the merger. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Abandonment by management; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Loss of sponsor; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Serious and persistent record-keeping problems; or </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Serious and persistent operational concerns. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any field of membership restrictions including numerical limitation requirements. Under this authority, any single occupational or associational common bond, multiple common bond, or community charter may merger into a multiple common bond credit union and that credit union can continue to serve the merging credit union's field of membership. Subsequent field of membership expansions of the continuing multiple common bond credit union must be consistent with multiple common bond policies. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.D.4—Purchase and Assumption (P&amp;A) </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&amp;A. Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions found in this chapter apply to purchase and assumptions where the purchasing credit union is a federal charter. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">A P&amp;A has limited application because, in most cases, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the few instances where a P&amp;A may occur, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency criteria are satisfied. Specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities, without regard to field of membership restrictions, may also be acquired without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments. Subsequent field of membership expansions must be consistent with multiple common bond policies. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">P&amp;As involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.D.5—Spin-Offs </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">All common bond requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group becomes a new charter or goes to an existing federal charter. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The request for approval of a spun-off group must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum: </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Why the spin-off is being requested; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• What part of the field of membership is to be spun off; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members; </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• The proposed spin-off date; and </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">• Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">For federal credit unions spinning off a group, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off—those whose shares are to be transferred—are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Spin-offs involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by all regional directors and, if applicable, the Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the credit unions are headquartered and the state regulators, as applicable. Spin-offs in the same region also require approval by the state regulator, as applicable. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">When an overlap situation requiring analysis does arise, officials of the expanding credit union must ascertain the views of the overlapped credit union. If the overlapped credit union does not object, the applicant must submit a letter or other documentation to that effect.

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In reviewing the overlap, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will consider: </p>

Where a sponsor organization expands its operations internally, by acquisition or otherwise, the credit union may serve these new entrants to its field of membership if they are part of any select group listed in Section 5. Where acquisitions are made which add a new subsidiary, the group cannot be served until the subsidiary is included in the field of membership through a housekeeping amendment. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Overlaps may occur as a result of restructuring or merger of the parent organization. When such overlaps occur, each credit union must request a field of membership amendment to reflect the new groups each wishes to serve. The credit union can continue to serve any current group in its field of membership that is acquiring a new group or has been acquired by a new group. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The new group cannot be served by the credit union until the field of membership amendment is approved by NCUA. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Credit unions affected by organizational restructuring or merger should attempt to resolve overlap issues among themselves. Unless an agreement is reached limiting the overlap resulting from the corporate restructuring, NCUA will permit a complete overlap of the credit unions' fields of membership. When two groups merge, or one group is acquired by the other, and each is in the field of membership of a credit union, both (or all affected) credit unions can serve the resulting merged or acquired group, subject to any existing geographic limitation and without regard to any overlap provisions. This is accomplished through a housekeeping amendment. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Credit unions must submit to NCUA documentation explaining the restructuring and provide information regarding the new organizational structure. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">IV.E.3—Exclusionary Clauses </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group otherwise included in its field of membership. NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new Chartering and Field of Membership Manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A credit union may request removal of a group from its field of membership for various reasons. The most common reasons for this type of amendment are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group is within the field of membership of two credit unions and one wishes to discontinue service; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The federal credit union cannot continue to provide adequate service to the group; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group has ceased to exist; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The group does not respond to repeated requests to contact the credit union or refuses to provide needed support; </p>

<p>NCUA has in place quality control processes that protect the integrity of its field of membership requirements. As part of this obligation, NCUA's Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion will randomly select groups added through NCUA's Field of Membership Internet Application (FOMIA) system for quality assurance reviews even if the expansion application meets all the conditions for approval. Each FCU is responsible for obtaining certain documentation when seeking to add groups to its field of membership through FOMIA. In addition, as indicated in the FOMIA User Instruction Guide, available on NCUA's Web site, an FCU must permanently retain the documentation from the select group requesting service and the Confirmation Certificate generated at the time the FOMIA request is submitted to NCUA. </p>
<p>As part of the quality assurance process, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion reserves the right to request this documentation at any time. If the FCU fails to provide this documentation when the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion requests it, the director of the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion may consider removing the group from the FCU's field of membership and restricting the FCU from using the FOMIA system for future requests.

<p>A number of persons, by virtue of their close relationship to a common bond group, may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following: </p>
<p>• Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Employees of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Persons retired as pensioners or annuitants from the above employment; </p>
<p>• Volunteers; </p>
<p>• Members of the immediate family or household; </p>
<p>• Honorably discharged veterans who served in any of the Armed Services of the United States in this charter; </p>
<p>• Organizations of such persons; and </p>
<p>• Corporate or other legal entities in this charter. </p>
<p>Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships. </p>
<p>Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit. </p>
<p>Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an “immediate family or household” of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household. </p>
<p>Volunteers, by virtue of their close relationship with a sponsor group, may be included. Examples include volunteers working at a hospital or church. </p>
<p>Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union.

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V—Community Charter Requirements </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.1—General </p>
<p>There are two types of community charters. One is based on a single, geographically well- defined local community or neighborhood; the other is a rural district. More than one credit union may serve the same community. </p>
<p>NCUA recognizes four types of affinity on which both a community charter and a rural district can be based—persons who live in, worship in, attend school in, or work in the community or rural district. Businesses and other legal entities within the community boundaries or rural district may also qualify for membership. </p>
<p>NCUA has established the following requirements for community charters: </p>
<p>• The geographic area's boundaries must be clearly defined; and </p>
<p>• The area is a well-defined local community or a rural district. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.2—Definition of Well-Defined Local Community and Rural District </p>
<p>In addition to the documentation requirements in Chapter 1 to charter a credit union, a community credit union applicant must provide additional documentation addressing the proposed area to be served and community service policies, as well as the business plan requirements set forth in this Chapter. An applicant must meet all of these requirements to obtain NCUA approval. </p>
<p>An applicant has the burden of demonstrating to NCUA that the proposed community area meets the statutory requirements of being: (1) Well-defined, and (2) a local community or rural district. The applicant also has the burden of demonstrating that with respect to the proposed community, it has the capacity to provide financial services to low- and moderate-income areas of the community. The agency will reject any application that fails to establish the criteria set forth above. </p>
<p>For an applicant seeking a community charter for a Statistical Area with multiple political jurisdictions with a population of 2.5 million people or more, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion (CURE) shall: (1) Publish a notice in the <span class="minor-caps">Federal Register</span> seeking comment from interested parties about the proposed community and (2) conduct a public hearing about this application. </p>

<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(Well-defined)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 “Well-defined”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">“Well-defined”</em>   means the proposed area has specific geographic boundaries. Geographic boundaries may include a city, township, county (single, multiple, or portions of a county) or a political equivalent, school districts, or a clearly identifiable neighborhood. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The well-defined local community requirement is met if: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Single Political Jurisdiction—the area to be served is a recognized Single Political Jurisdiction, <em>i.e.,</em> a city, county, or their political equivalent, or any single portion thereof. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Statistical Area—A statistical area is all or an individual portion of a Combined Statistical Area (CSA) or a Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA) designated by the U.S. Census Bureau, including a Metropolitan Statistical Area. To meet the well-defined local community requirement, the CSA or CBSA or a portion thereof, must be contiguous and have a population of 2.5 million or less people. An individual portion of a statistical area need not conform to internal boundaries within the area, such as metropolitan division boundaries within a Core-Based Statistical Area. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Compelling Evidence of Common Interests or Interaction—In lieu of a statistical area as defined above, this option is available when a credit union seeks to initially charter a community credit union; to expand an existing community; or to convert to a community charter. Under this option, the credit union must demonstrate that the areas in question are contiguous and further demonstrate a sufficient level of common interests or interaction among area residents to qualify the area as a local community. For that purpose, an applicant must submit for NCUA approval a narrative, supported by appropriate documentation, establishing that the area's residents meet the requirements of a local community. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">To assist a credit union in developing its narrative, Appendix 6 of this Manual identifies criteria a narrative should address, and which NCUA will consider in deciding a credit union's application to: Initially charter a community credit union; to expand an existing community, including by an adjacent area addition; or to convert to a community charter. In any case, the credit union must demonstrate, through its business and marketing plans, its ability and commitment to serve the entire community for which it seeks NCUA approval. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An area of any geographic size qualifies as a Rural District if: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The proposed district has well-defined, contiguous geographic boundaries; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The total population of the proposed district does not exceed 1,000,000; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Either more than 50% of the proposed district's population resides in census blocks or other geographic units that are designated as rural by either the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the United States Census Bureau, OR the district has a population density of 100 persons or fewer per square mile; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The boundaries of the well-defined rural district do not exceed the outer boundaries of the states that are <em>immediately contiguous</em> to the state in which the credit union maintains its headquarters (<em>i.e.,</em> not to exceed the outer perimeter of the layer of states immediately surrounding the headquarters state). </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The common bond affinity groups that apply to well-defined local communities also apply to Rural Districts. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The requirements in Chapter 2, Sections V.A.4 through V.G also apply to a credit union that serves a rural district. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.3—Previously Approved Communities </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If NCUA has determined that a specific geographic area is a well-defined local community, then a new applicant need not reestablish that fact as part of its application to serve the exact area. The new applicant must, however, note NCUA's previous determination as part of its overall application. An applicant applying for an area that is not exactly the same as a previously approved well defined local community must comply with the current criteria in place for determining a well-defined local community. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.4—Business Plan Requirements for a Community Credit Union </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A community credit union is frequently more susceptible to competition from other local financial institutions and generally does not have substantial support from any single sponsoring company or association. As a result, a community credit union will often encounter financial and operational factors that differ from an occupational or associational charter. Its diverse membership may require special marketing programs targeted to different segments of the community. For example, the lack of payroll deduction creates special challenges in the development and promotion of savings programs and in the collection of loans. Accordingly, to support an application for a community charter, an applicant Federal credit union must develop a business plan incorporating the following data: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Pro forma financial statements for a minimum of 24 months after the proposed conversion, including the underlying assumptions and rationale for projected member, share, loan, and asset growth; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Anticipated financial impact on the credit union, including the need for additional employees and fixed assets, and the associated costs; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A description of the current and proposed office/branch structure, including a general description of the location(s); parking availability, public transportation availability, drive-through service, lobby capacity, or any other service feature illustrating community access; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A marketing plan addressing how the community will be served for the 24-month period after the proposed conversion to a community charter, including detailing: How the credit union will implement its business plan; the unique needs of the various demographic groups in the proposed community; how the credit union will market to each group, particularly underserved groups; which community-based organizations the credit union will target in its outreach efforts; the credit union's marketing budget projections dedicating greater resources to reaching new members; and the credit union's timetable for implementation, not just a calendar of events; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Details, terms and conditions of the credit union's financial products, programs, and services to be provided to the entire community; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Maps showing the current and proposed service facilities, ATMs, political boundaries, major roads, and other pertinent information. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An existing Federal credit union may apply to convert to a community charter. Groups currently in the credit union's field of membership, but outside the new community credit union's boundaries, may not be included in the new community charter. Therefore, the credit union must notify groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of the conversion. Members of record can continue to be served. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Before approval of an application to convert to a community credit union, NCUA must be satisfied that the credit union will be viable and capable of providing services to its members. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Community credit unions will be expected to regularly review and to follow, to the fullest extent economically possible, the marketing and business plans submitted with their applications. Additionally, NCUA will follow-up with an FCU every year for three years after the FCU has been granted a new or expanded community charter, and at any other intervals NCUA believes appropriate, to determine if the FCU is satisfying the terms of its marketing and business plans. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An FCU failing to satisfy those terms will be subject to supervisory action. As part of this review process, the regional office or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director will report to the NCUA Board instances where an FCU is failing to satisfy the terms of its marketing and business plan and indicate what supervisory actions the region or ONES intends to take. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.5—Community Boundaries </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The geographic boundaries of a community Federal credit union are the areas defined in its charter. The boundaries can usually be defined using political borders, streets, rivers, railroad tracks, or other static geographical feature. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A community that is a recognized legal entity may be stated in the field of membership— for example, “Gus Township, Texas,” “Isabella City, Georgia,” or “Fairfax County, Virginia.” </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A community that is an entire United States Census Bureau designated Core Based Statistical Area or Combined Statistical Area may be stated in the field of membership—for example, “Fort Wayne, IN Metropolitan Statistical Area,” “Albany, GA Metropolitan Statistical Area,” or “Syracuse-Auburn, NY Combined Statistical Area.” </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.6—Special Community Charters </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A community field of membership may include persons who work or attend school in a particular industrial park, shopping mall, office building or complex, or similar development. The proposed field of membership must have clearly defined geographic boundaries. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.7—Ample Community Fields of Membership </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A community charter does not have to include all four affinities (<em>i.e.,</em> live, work, worship, or attend school in a community). Some examples of community fields of membership are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in, and businesses located in the area of Johnson City, Tennessee, bounded by Fern Street on the north, Long Street on the east, Fourth Street on the south, and Elm Avenue on the west; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live or work in Green County, Maine; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live, worship, work (or regularly conduct business in), or attend school on the University of Dayton campus, in Dayton, Ohio; </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live, work, or worship in the Binghamton, New York, Core Based Statistical Area, consisting of Broome and Tioga Counties, New York (a qualifying Core Based Statistical Area in its entirety); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in the portion of the Oklahoma City, OK Metropolitan Statistical Area that includes Canadian and Oklahoma counties, Oklahoma (two contiguous counties in a portion of a qualifying Core Based Statistical Area that has seven counties in total); or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school in Uinta County or Lincoln County, Wyoming, a rural district. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Some examples of insufficiently defined local communities, neighborhoods, or rural districts are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live or work within and businesses located within a ten-mile radius of Washington, DC (not a permitted community); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live or work in the industrial section of New York, New York. (not well- defined nor a permitted community); or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live or work in the greater Boston area. (not well-defined). </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Some examples of unacceptable local communities, neighborhoods, or rural districts are: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live or work in the State of California. (not a permitted community). Persons who live in the first congressional district of Florida. (not a permitted community). </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.A.8—Community Selection Requirements and Review </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The NCUA will not approve an application for a community charter consisting of all or a portion of a CSA or a CBSA, including an initial application, amendment, or expansion, unless the applicant demonstrates in its business and marketing plan that (1) the credit union will serve a community that is contiguous and (2) the credit union will provide financial services to low- and moderate-income and underserved people, and that the credit union has not selected its service area in order to exclude low- and moderate-income and underserved people or to engage in illegal discrimination. Upon receipt of this material, the NCUA will evaluate the business and marketing plan to ensure that low- and moderate-income and underserved people will be served and that the credit union has not selected the service area in order to exclude such people or to engage in illegal discrimination. This requirement is in addition to the requirement to document in the business and marketing plan the realistic assumptions that support the credit union's viability and its plan to serve its entire FOM. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The NCUA may conduct such further inquiry or evaluation as it deems appropriate, as authorized by <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1754" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1754</a> and consistent with the principles of this Manual, other federal laws, and public policy. If the NCUA determines that the credit union's submission is inaccurate or unsupported, it may deny that application on those grounds, regardless of whether the application satisfies the other criteria for initial chartering, amendment, or expansion. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V.B—Field of Membership Amendments </p>
<p>A community credit union may amend its field of membership by adding additional affinities or removing exclusionary clauses. This can be accomplished with a housekeeping amendment. </p>
<p>A community credit union also may expand its geographic boundaries. Persons who live, work, worship, or attend school within the proposed well-defined local community, neighborhood or rural district must have common interests and/or interact. The credit union must follow the requirements of Section V.A.4 and Section V.A.8 of this chapter. </p>
<p>A community credit union that is based on a Single Political Jurisdiction, a Statistical Area (<em>e.g.,</em> Core Based Statistical Area or Combined Statistical Area) or a rural district may expand its geographic boundaries to add a bordering area, provided the area is well defined and the credit union demonstrates that persons who live, work, worship, or attend school within the proposed expanded community (<em>i.e.,</em> on both sides of the boundary separating the existing community and the bordering area) have common interests and/or interact. Such a credit union applying to expand its geographic boundaries to add a bordering area must follow a streamlined version of the business plan requirements of Section V.A.4 of this chapter and the expanded community would be subject to the corresponding population limit—2.5 million in the case of a Single Political Jurisdiction, or a Statistical Area and 1 million in the case of a rural district. The streamlined business plan requirements for adding a bordering area are: </p>
<p>• Anticipated marginal financial impact on the credit union of adding the proposed bordering area, including the need for additional employees and fixed assets, and the associated costs; </p>
<p>• A description of the current and, if applicable, proposed office/branch structure specific to serving the proposed bordering area; </p>
<p>• A marketing plan addressing how the new community will be served for the 24-month period after the proposed expansion of a community charter, including detailing how the credit union will address the unique needs of any demographic groups in the proposed bordering community not presently served by the credit union and how the credit union will market to any new groups; and </p>
<p>• Details, terms and conditions of any new financial products, programs, and services to be introduced as part of this expansion. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V.C—NCUA Procedures for Amending the Field of Membership </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.C.1—General </p>
<p>All requests for approval to amend a community credit union's charter must be submitted to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. If a decision cannot be made within a reasonable period of time, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will notify the credit union. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.C.2—NCUA's Decision </p>
<p>The financial and operational condition of the requesting credit union will be considered in every instance. The economic advisability of expanding the field of membership of a credit union with financial or operational problems must be carefully considered. </p>
<p>In most cases, field of membership amendments will only be approved for credit unions that are operating satisfactorily. Generally, if a federal credit union is having difficulty providing service to its current membership, or is experiencing financial or other operational problems, it may have more difficulty serving an expanded field of membership. </p>
<p>Occasionally, however, an expanded field of membership may provide the basis for reversing current financial problems. In such cases, an amendment to expand the field of membership may be granted notwithstanding the credit union's financial or operational problems. The applicant credit union must clearly establish that the expanded field of membership is in the best interest of the members and will not increase the risk to the NCUSIF. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.C.3—NCUA Approval </p>
<p>If the requested amendment is approved by NCUA, the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.C.4—NCUA Disapproval </p>
<p>When NCUA disapproves any application to amend the field of membership, in whole or in part, under this chapter, the applicant will be informed in writing of the: </p>
<p>• Specific reasons for the action; </p>
<p>• If appropriate, options or suggestions that could be considered for gaining approval; and </p>
<p>• Appeal procedures. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.C.5—Appeal of Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director Decision </p>
<p>If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director denies a field of membership expansion request, merger, or spin-off, that decision may be appealed to the NCUA Board in accordance with the procedures set forth in subpart B to <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-746" class="cfr external">part 746 of this chapter</a>. </p>
<p>Before appealing, the credit union may, within 30 days of the denial, provide supplemental information to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director for reconsideration. A request for reconsideration should contain new and material evidence addressing the reasons for the initial denial or explain extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of existing material evidence or information that should have been filed with the request for reconsideration. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will have 30 days from the date of the receipt of the request for reconsideration to make a final decision. If the request is again denied, the applicant may proceed with the appeal process within 60 days of the date of the last denial. A petitioner may seek a second reconsideration based on new material evidence or information or extenuating circumstances that precluded the inclusion of such information in the previous request. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V.D—Mergers, Purchase and Assumptions, and Spin-Offs </p>
<p>There are three additional ways a community federal credit union can expand its field of membership: </p>
<p>• By taking in the field of membership of another credit union through a merger; </p>
<p>• By taking in the field of membership through a purchase and assumption (P&amp;A); or </p>
<p>• By taking a portion of another credit union's field of membership through a spin-off. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.D.1—Mergers </p>
<p>Generally, the requirements applicable to field of membership expansions apply to mergers where the continuing credit union is a community federal charter. </p>
<p>Where both credit unions are community charters, the continuing credit union must meet the criteria for expanding the community boundaries. A community credit union cannot merge into a single occupational/associational, or multiple common bond credit union, except in an emergency merger. However, a single occupational or associational, or multiple common bond credit union can merge into a community charter as long as the merging credit union has a service facility within the community boundaries or a majority of the merging credit union's field of membership would qualify for membership in the community charter. While a community charter may take in an occupational, associational, or multiple common bond credit union in a merger, it will remain a community charter. </p>
<p>Groups within the merging credit union's field of membership located outside of the community boundaries may not continue to be served. The merging credit union must notify groups that will be removed from the field of membership as a result of the merger. However, the credit union may continue to serve members of record. </p>
<p>Where a state-chartered credit union is merging into a community federal credit union, the continuing federal credit union's field of membership will be worded in accordance with NCUA policy. Any subsequent field of membership expansions must comply with applicable amendment procedures. </p>
<p>Mergers must be approved by the NCUA regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union, and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.D.2—Emergency Mergers </p>
<p>An emergency merger may be approved by NCUA without regard to common bond or other legal constraints. An emergency merger involves NCUA's direct intervention and approval. The credit union to be merged must either be insolvent or in danger of insolvency, as defined in the Glossary, and NCUA must determine that: </p>
<p>• An emergency requiring expeditious action exists; </p>
<p>• Other alternatives are not reasonably available; and </p>
<p>• The public interest would best be served by approving the merger. </p>
<p>If not corrected, conditions that could lead to insolvency include, but are not limited to: </p>
<p>• Abandonment by management; </p>
<p>• Loss of sponsor; </p>
<p>• Serious and persistent record-keeping problems; or </p>
<p>• Serious and persistent operational concerns. </p>
<p>In an emergency merger situation, NCUA will take an active role in finding a suitable merger partner (continuing credit union). NCUA is primarily concerned that the continuing credit union has the financial strength and management expertise to absorb the troubled credit union without adversely affecting its own financial condition and stability. </p>
<p>As a stipulated condition to an emergency merger, the field of membership of the merging credit union may be transferred intact to the continuing federal credit union without regard to any field of membership restrictions, including the service facility requirement. Under this authority, a federal credit union may take in any dissimilar field of membership. </p>
<p>Even though the merging credit union is a single common bond credit union or multiple common bond credit union or community credit union, the continuing credit union will remain a community charter. Future community expansions will be based on the continuing credit union's original community area. </p>
<p>Emergency mergers involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the merging credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.D.3—Purchase and Assumption (P&amp;A) </p>
<p>Another alternative for acquiring the field of membership of a failing credit union is through a consolidation known as a P&amp;A. Generally, the requirements applicable to community expansions found in this chapter apply to purchase and assumptions where the purchasing credit union is a federal charter. </p>
<p>A P&amp;A has limited application because, in most instances, the failing credit union must be placed into involuntary liquidation. However, in the few instances where a P&amp;A may occur, the assuming federal credit union, as with emergency mergers, may acquire the entire field of membership if the emergency criteria are satisfied. </p>
<p>In a P&amp;A processed under the emergency criteria, specified loans, shares, and certain other designated assets and liabilities may also be acquired without regard to field of membership restrictions and without changing the character of the continuing federal credit union for purposes of future field of membership amendments. </p>
<p>If the P&amp;A does not meet the emergency criteria, then only members of record can be obtained unless they otherwise qualify for membership in the community charter. </p>
<p>P&amp;As involving federally insured credit unions in different NCUA regions must be approved by the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director where the continuing credit union is headquartered, with the concurrence of the regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director of the purchased and/or assumed credit union and, as applicable, the state regulators. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.D.4—Spin-Offs </p>
<p>A spin-off occurs when, by agreement of the parties, a portion of the field of membership, assets, liabilities, shares, and capital of a credit union are transferred to a new or existing credit union. A spin-off is unique in that usually one credit union has a field of membership expansion and the other loses a portion of its field of membership. </p>
<p>All field of membership requirements apply regardless of whether the spun-off group goes to a new or existing federal charter. </p>
<p>The request for approval of a spin-off must be supported with a plan that addresses, at a minimum: </p>
<p>• Why the spin-off is being requested; </p>
<p>• What part of the field of membership is to be spun off; </p>
<p>• Whether the field of membership requirements are met; </p>
<p>• Which assets, liabilities, shares, and capital are to be transferred; </p>
<p>• The financial impact the spin-off will have on the affected credit unions; </p>
<p>• The ability of the acquiring credit union to effectively serve the new members; </p>
<p>• The proposed spin-off date; and </p>
<p>• Disclosure to the members of the requirements set forth above. </p>
<p>The spin-off request must also include current financial statements from the affected credit unions and the proposed voting ballot. </p>
<p>For federal credit unions spinning off a portion of the community, membership notice and voting requirements and procedures are the same as for mergers (see part 708 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations), except that only the members directly affected by the spin-off—those whose shares are to be transferred—are permitted to vote. Members whose shares are not being transferred will not be afforded the opportunity to vote. All members of the group to be spun off (whether they voted in favor, against, or not at all) will be transferred if the spin-off is approved by the voting membership. Voting requirements for federally insured state credit unions are governed by state law. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V.E—Overlaps </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.E.1—General </p>
<p>Generally, an overlap exists when a group of persons is eligible for membership in two or more credit unions. NCUA will permit community credit unions to overlap any other charters without performing an overlap analysis. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">V.E.2—Exclusionary Clauses </p>
<p>An exclusionary clause is a limitation precluding the credit union from serving the primary members of a portion of a group or community otherwise included in its field of membership. </p>
<p>NCUA no longer grants exclusionary clauses. Those granted prior to the adoption of this new Chartering and Field of Membership Manual will remain in effect unless the credit unions agree to remove them or one of the affected credit unions submits a housekeeping amendment to have it removed. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V.F—Charter Conversions </p>
<p>A community federal credit union may convert to a single occupational or associational, or multiple common bond credit union. The converting credit union must meet all occupational, associational, and multiple common bond requirements, as applicable. The converting credit union may continue to serve members of record of the prior field of membership as of the date of the conversion, and any groups or communities obtained in an emergency merger or P&amp;A. A change to the credit union's field of membership and designated common bond will be necessary. </p>
<p>A community credit union may convert to serve a new geographical area provided the field of membership requirements of V.A.3 of this chapter are met. Members of record of the original community can continue to be served. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">V.G—Other Persons With a Relationship to the Community </p>
<p>A number of persons who have a close relationship to the community may be included, at the charter applicant's option, in the field of membership. These include the following: </p>
<p>• Spouses of persons who died while within the field of membership of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Employees of this credit union; </p>
<p>• Volunteers in the community; </p>
<p>• Members of the immediate family or household; and </p>
<p>• Organizations of such persons </p>
<p>Immediate family is defined as spouse, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild. This includes stepparents, stepchildren, stepsiblings, and adoptive relationships. </p>
<p>Household is defined as persons living in the same residence maintaining a single economic unit. </p>
<p>Membership eligibility is extended only to individuals who are members of an “immediate family or household” of a credit union member. It is not necessary for the primary member to join the credit union in order for the immediate family or household member of the primary member to join, provided the immediate family or household clause is included in the field of membership. However, it is necessary for the immediate family member or household member to first join in order for that person's immediate family member or household member to join the credit union. A credit union can adopt a more restrictive definition of immediate family or household. </p>
<p>Under the Federal Credit Union Act, once a person becomes a member of the credit union, such person may remain a member of the credit union until the person chooses to withdraw or is expelled from the membership of the credit union. This is commonly referred to as “once a member, always a member.” The “once a member, always a member” provision does not prevent a credit union from restricting services to members who are no longer within the field of membership. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">I—Introduction </p>
<p>One of the primary reasons for the creation of federal credit unions is to make credit available to people of modest means for provident and productive purposes. To help NCUA fulfill this mission, the agency has established special operational policies for federal credit unions that serve low-income groups and underserved areas. The policies provide a greater degree of flexibility that will enhance and invigorate capital infusion into low-income groups, low-income communities, and underserved areas. These unique policies are necessary to provide credit unions serving low-income groups with financial stability and potential for controlled growth and to encourage the formation of new charters as well as the delivery of credit union services in low-income communities. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701">II—Low-Income Credit Union </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(II.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(II.)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 II.">II. A—Defined </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A credit union serving predominantly low-income members may be designated as a low- income credit union. Section 701.34 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations defines the term “low- income members” as those members: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Who make less than 80 percent of the average for all wage earners as established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; or </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Whose median family income falls at or below 80 percent of the median family income for the nation as established by the Census Bureau. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The term “low-income members” also includes members who are full-time or part-time students in a college, university, high school, or vocational school. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">To obtain a low-income designation from NCUA, an existing credit union must establish that a majority of its members meet the low-income definition. An existing community credit union that serves a geographic area where a majority of residents meet the annual income standard is presumed to be serving predominantly low-income members. A low-income designation for a new credit union charter may be based on a majority of the potential membership. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.B—Special Programs </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A credit union with a low-income designation has greater flexibility in accepting nonmember deposits insured by the NCUSIF, are exempt from the aggregate loan limit on business loans, and may offer secondary capital accounts to strengthen its capital base. It also may participate in special funding programs such as the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions (CDRLP) if it is involved in the stimulation of economic development and community revitalization efforts. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The CDRLP provides both loans and grants for technical assistance to low-income credit unions. The requirements for participation in the revolving loan program are in part 705 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Only operating credit unions are eligible for participation in this program. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.C—Low-Income Documentation </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union charter applicant or existing credit union wishing to receive a low- income designation should forward a separate request for the designation to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director, along with appropriate documentation supporting the request. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">For community charter applicants, the supporting material should include the median family income or annual wage figures for the community to be served. If this information is unavailable, the applicant should identify the individual zip codes or census tracts that comprise the community and NCUA will assist in obtaining the necessary demographic data. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Similarly, if single occupational or associational or multiple common bond charter applicants cannot supply income data on its potential members, they should provide the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director with a list which includes the number of potential members, sorted by their residential zip codes, and NCUA will assist in obtaining the necessary demographic data. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">An existing credit union can perform a loan or membership survey to determine if the credit union is primarily serving low-income members. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.D—Third-Party Assistance </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A low-income federal credit union charter applicant may contract with a third party to assist in the chartering and low-income designation process. If the charter is granted, a low-income credit union may contract with a third party to provide necessary management services. Such contracts should not exceed the duration of one year subject to renewal. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.E—Special Rules for Low-Income Federal Credit Unions </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In recognition of the unique efforts needed to help make credit union service available to low-income groups, NCUA has adopted special rules that pertain to low-income credit union charters, as well as field of membership additions for low-income credit unions. These special rules provide additional latitude to enable underserved, low-income individuals to gain access to credit union service. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">NCUA permits credit union chartering and field of membership amendments based on associational groups formed for the sole purpose of making credit union service available to low- income persons. The association must be defined so that all of its members will meet the low- income definition of Section 701.34 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. Any multiple common bond credit union can add low-income associations to their fields of membership. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A low-income designated community federal credit union has additional latitude in serving persons who are affiliated with the community. In addition to serving members who live, work, worship, or attend school in the community, a low-income community federal credit union may also serve persons who participate in programs to alleviate poverty or distress, or who participate in associations headquartered in the community. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Examples of a low-income designated community and an associational-based low-income federal credit union are as follows: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Persons who live in [the target area]; persons who work, worship, attend school, or participate in associations headquartered in [the target area]; persons participating in programs to alleviate poverty or distress which are located in [the target area]; incorporated and unincorporated organizations located in [the target area] or maintaining a facility in [the target area]; and organizations of such persons. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Members of the Canarsie Economic Assistance League, in Brooklyn, NY, an association whose members all meet the low-income definition of Section 701.34 of the NCUA Rules and Regulations. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A multiple common bond federal credit union may include in its field of membership, without regard to location, an “underserved area” as defined by the Federal Credit Union Act. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1759" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1759(c)(2)</a>. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The addition of an “underserved area” will not change the charter type of the multiple common bond federal credit union. More than one multiple common-bond federal credit union can serve the same “underserved area,” provided each credit union is approved as provided below. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">By adding an “underserved area,” a multiple common bond federal credit union does not become eligible to receive the benefits afforded to low-income designated credit unions, such as expanded use of nonmember deposits and access to the Community Development Revolving Loan Program for Credit Unions. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.B—“Underserved Area” Defined </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Federal Credit Union Act defines an “underserved area” as (1) a “local community, neighborhood, or rural district” that (2) meets the definition of an “investment area” under section 103(16) of the Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994 (“CDFI”), <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4702" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 4702(16)</a>, and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4702" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(3)</a> is “underserved by other depository institutions” based on data of the NCUA Board and the federal banking agencies. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">III.B.1—Local Community </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">To be eligible for approval as “underserved,” a proposed area must be a well-defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district as defined in Chapter 2, sections V.A.1. and V.A.2. of this Manual. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">III.B.2—Investment Area </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">To be approved as an “underserved area,” the proposed area must meet the CDFI definition of an “investment area.” <em>Id.</em> § 4702(16). A proposed area that, at the time the credit union applies, is designated in its entirety as an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community (<em>id.</em> § 1391) automatically qualifies as an “investment area”; no further criteria of an “investment area” must be met. <em>Id.</em> § 4702(16)(B). A proposed area that is not designated as such must qualify as an “investment area” under “the objective criteria of economic distress” developed by the CDFI Fund (“distress criteria”) based on current decennial U.S. Census data, and also must have “significant unmet needs” for loans and financial services that credit unions are authorized to offer to their members. <em>Id.</em> § 4702(16)(A). </p>

At least 85 percent (85%) of the area's total population must reside within the units that are “distressed,” <em>i.e.,</em> that meet one of the applicable economic distress criteria above, as reported by the decennial Census (Unemployment, Poverty and MFI for census tracts plus, for counties only, Population Loss and Migration Loss); the balance of the area's population may reside in the non-“distressed” tract(s). The population threshold is met, and the whole proposed area qualifies as “distressed,” when the “distressed” units represent at least 85 percent of the area's total population. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">III.B.2.b—Proposed Area's “Significant Unmet Needs” </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">A proposed area that is “distressed” also must display “significant unmet needs” for loans or for one or more of the financial services credit unions are authorized to offer. To meet this criterion, the credit union must include within its Business Plan a section, one page in length, entitled “Significant Unmet Needs for Credit Union Services” (“SUN section”) that establishes the existence of such unmet needs by identifying the credit and depository needs of the community and detailing how the credit union plans to serve those needs. The credit union may choose which among the following “credit and depository needs” to address in the SUN section: loans, share draft accounts, savings accounts, check cashing, money orders, certified checks, automated teller machines, deposit taking, safe deposit box services, and similar services. The existence of each “credit and depository need” the credit union identifies and plans to serve must be supported by objective reasons and/or accompanying documentation derived from an identified, authoritative source of the credit union's choice. Third-party documentation generally is the most compelling. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">III.B.3—Underserved by Other Depository Institutions </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">A proposed area that meets the CDFI definition of an “investment area” (<em>i.e.,</em> is “distressed” and has “significant unmet needs”) must also be underserved by other insured depository institutions, including credit unions. <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/1759" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 1759(c)(2)(A)(ii)</a>. This statutory criterion is met when the concentration of depository institution facilities among the population of the proposed area's non-“distressed” tracts—which sets a benchmark level of adequate service—is greater than the concentration of facilities among the population of all of the proposed area's census tracts combined. This establishes the area's concentration of facilities ratio. If there are no non- “distressed” tracts within a proposed area, a non-“distressed” census tract or larger geographic unit (<em>e.g.,</em> city or county) of the credit union's choice that adjoins the proposed area may be used to set the benchmark concentration ratio. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Without regard to a proposed area's location within or outside a Metropolitan Statistical Area, this criterion compares two ratios: the ratio of facilities to the population of the non- “distressed” tracts (the benchmark) versus the same facilities-to-population ratio among all the tracts of the proposed area as a whole. If the benchmark ratio is greater than the ratio for the whole area, then the area is “underserved by other depository institutions,” and vice versa. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">When, as the result of an initial Concentration of Facilities ratio calculation, a proposed area does not qualify as “underserved by other depository institutions,” NCUA will exclude non- depository banks (<em>e.g.,</em> trust companies) and non-community credit unions (<em>i.e.,</em> those institutions unable to serve the general public) from the computation. For the purposes of this analysis, a multiple common bond credit union already serving the area as an underserved area is considered able to serve the general public and thus would not be excluded. With both of these exclusions, NCUA will recalculate the concentration of facilities ratio to determine whether, as a result, the proposed area qualifies as “underserved by other depository institutions.” </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">As one alternative to the concentration of facilities ratio, a proposed area will qualify as “underserved by other depository institutions” if it is designated an “underserved county” by NCUA based on data produced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (available at: <em><a href="http://www.consumerfinance.gov/guidance/#ruralunderserved" class="external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">http://www.consumerfinance.gov/guidance/#ruralunderserved</a></em><em>).</em> NCUA will make its list of “underserved counties” available on its Web site. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">As another alternative to the concentration of facilities ratio, a proposed area will qualify as “underserved by other depository institutions” if the credit seeking to serve it, using a metric of its own choosing, provided that it is based on NCUA or other Federal banking agency data, that establishes to NCUA that the proposed area is “underserved by other depository institutions.” </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.C—NCUA Approval </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">If NCUA approves the request to add an “underserved area,” the credit union will be issued an amendment to Section 5 of its charter. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.D—Approval to Serve an Already Approved “Underserved Area” </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Once a credit union is initially approved to serve an “underserved area,” other credit unions that subsequently apply may be approved to serve the same area. To be approved, the area must qualify as “underserved” at the time the new applicant applies. An applicant must demonstrate that the area continues to be “distressed”, as provided above, only if a new decennial Census has been published since the date the area was last approved. In any case, the applicant must demonstrate that the area still has “significant unmet needs” for loans or credit union services (to qualify as an “investment area”), and remains “underserved by other depository institutions” (to qualify as “underserved”). </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.E—Business Plan </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">A federal credit union that desires to include an underserved community in its field of membership must first develop, and submit for approval, a business plan specifying how it will serve the community. In addition, the business plan must include a SUN section as provided in section III.B.2.b. above. The credit union will be expected to regularly review the business plan to determine if the community is being adequately served. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may require periodic service status reports from a credit union about the “underserved area” to ensure that the needs of the community are being met, and must require such reports before NCUA allows a multiple common bond federal credit union to add an additional “underserved area.” </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.F—Service Facility </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">Once an “underserved area” has been added to a federal credit union's field of membership, the credit union must establish within two years, and maintain, an office or service facility in the community. A service facility is defined as a place where shares are accepted for members' accounts, loan applications are accepted and loans are disbursed. By definition, a service facility includes a credit union-owned branch, a shared branch, a mobile branch, an office operated on a regularly scheduled weekly basis, or a credit union-owned electronic facility that meets, at a minimum, the above requirements. A service facility also includes a shared branch or a shared branch network location, including an electronic facility that meets the above requirements, if a credit union participates in a shared branching network. </p>
<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">This definition does not include an ATM or the credit union's internet website. </p>

<p>A charter conversion is a change in the jurisdictional authority under which a credit union operates. </p>
<p>Federal credit unions receive their charters from NCUA and are subject to its supervision, examination, and regulation. </p>
<p>State-chartered credit unions are incorporated in a particular state, receiving their charter from the state agency responsible for credit unions and subject to the state's regulator. If the state-chartered credit union's deposits are federally insured, it will also fall under NCUA's jurisdiction. </p>
<p>A federal credit union's power and authority are derived from the Federal Credit Union Act and NCUA Rules and Regulations. State-chartered credit unions are governed by state law and regulation. Certain federal laws and regulations also apply to federally insured state chartered credit unions. </p>
<p>There are two types of charter conversions: federal charter to state charter and state charter to federal charter. Common bond and community requirements are not an issue from NCUA's standpoint in the case of a federal to state charter conversion. The procedures and forms relevant to both types of charter conversion are included in appendix 4. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(II.)">
<p class="hd2-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-B-to-Part-701(II.)" data-title="Appendix-B-to-Part-701 II.">II. A—General Requirements </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Any state-chartered credit union may apply to convert to a federal credit union. In order to do so it must: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Comply with state law regarding conversion and file proof of compliance with NCUA; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• File the required conversion application, proposed federal credit union organization certificate, and other documents with NCUA; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Comply with the requirements of the Federal Credit Union Act, <em>e.g.,</em> chartering and reserve requirements; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Be granted federal share insurance by NCUA. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Conversions are treated the same as any initial application for a federal charter, including an on-site examination by NCUA where appropriate. NCUA will also consult with the appropriate state authority regarding the credit union's current financial condition, management expertise, and past performance. Since the applicant in a conversion is an ongoing credit union, the economic advisability of granting a charter is more readily determinable than in the case of an initial charter applicant. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">A converting state credit union's field of membership must conform to NCUA's chartering policy. The field of membership will be phrased in accordance with NCUA chartering policy. However, if the converting credit union is a multiple group charter and the new federal charter is a multiple group, then the new federal charter may retain in its field of membership any group that the state credit union was serving at the time of conversion. Subsequent changes must conform to NCUA chartering policy in effect at that time. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the converting credit union is a community charter and the new federal charter is community-based, it must meet the community field of membership requirements set forth in Chapter 2, Section V of this manual. If the state-chartered credit union's community boundary is more expansive than the approved federal boundary, only members of record outside of the new community boundary may continue to be served. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The converting credit union, regardless of charter type, may continue to serve members of record. The converting credit union may retain in its field of membership any group or community added pursuant to state emergency provisions. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.B—Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The following documents must be submitted with the conversion proposal: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Conversion of State Charter to Federal Charter (NCUA 4000); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Organization Certificate (NCUA 4008). Only Part (3) and the signature/notary section should be completed and, where applicable, signed by the credit union officials. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Report of Officials and Agreement to Serve (NCUA 4012); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The Application to Convert From State Credit Union to Federal Credit Union (NCUA 4401); </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Certification of Resolution (NCUA 9501); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Written evidence regarding whether the state regulator is in agreement with the conversion proposal; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Business plan, as appropriate, including the most current financial report and delinquent loan schedule. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the state charter is applying to become a federal community charter, it must also comply with the documentation requirements included in Chapter 2, Section V.A.2 of this manual. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II.C—NCUA Consideration of Application To Convert </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">II.C.1—Review by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The application will be reviewed to determine that it is complete and that the proposal is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act. This review will include a determination that the state credit union's field of membership is in compliance with NCUA's chartering policies. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director may make further investigation into the proposal and may require the submission of additional information to support the request to convert. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">II.C.2—On-Site Review </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">NCUA may conduct an on-site examination of the books and records of the credit union. Non-federally insured credit unions will be assessed an insurance application fee. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">II.C.3—Approval by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director and Conditions to the Approval </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The conversion will be approved by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director if it is in compliance with Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act and meets the criteria for federal insurance. Where applicable, the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will specify any special conditions that the credit union must meet in order to convert to a federal charter, including changes to the credit union's field of membership in order to conform to NCUA's chartering policies. Some of these conditions may be set forth in a Letter of Understanding and Agreement (LUA), which requires the signature of the officials and the appropriate NCUA regional director or Office of National Examinations and Supervision Director. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">II.C.4—Notification </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director will notify both the credit union and the state regulator of the decision on the conversion. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Changing of the credit union's name on all signage, records, accounts, investments, and other documents should be accomplished as soon as possible after conversion. The credit union has 180 days from the effective date of the conversion to change its signage and promotional material. This requires the credit union to discontinue using any remaining stock of “state credit union” stationery immediately, and discontinue using credit cards, ATM cards, etc., within 180 days after the effective date of the conversion, or the reissue date whichever is later. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director has the discretion to extend the timeframe for an additional 180 days. Member share drafts with the state-chartered name can be used by the members until depleted. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">II.E.5—Reports to NCUA </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Any federal credit union may apply to convert to a state credit union. In order to do so, it must: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Notify NCUA prior to commencing the process to convert to a state charter and state the reason(s) for the conversion; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Comply with the requirements of Section 125 of the Federal Credit Union Act that enable it to convert to a state credit union and to cease being a federal credit union; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Comply with applicable state law and the requirements of the state regulator. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">It is important that the credit union provide an accurate disclosure of the reasons for the conversion. These reasons should be stated in specific terms, not as generalities. The federal credit union converting to a state charter remains responsible for the entire operating fee for the year in which it converts. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.B—Special Provisions Regarding Federal Share Insurance </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the federal credit union intends to continue federal share insurance after the conversion to a state credit union, it must submit an Application for Insurance of Accounts (NCUA 9600) to the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director at the time it requests approval of the conversion proposal. The Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director has the authority to approve or disapprove the application. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If the converting federal credit union does not intend to continue federal share insurance or if its application for continued insurance is denied, insurance will cease in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If, upon its conversion to a state credit union, the federal credit union will be terminating its federal share insurance or converting from federal to non-federal share insurance, it must comply with the membership notice and voting procedures set forth in Section 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act and part 708 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations, and address the criteria set forth in Section 205(c) of the Federal Credit Union Act. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Where the state credit union will be non-federally insured, federal insurance ceases on the effective date of the charter conversion. If it will be otherwise uninsured, then federal insurance will cease one year after the date of conversion subject to the restrictions in Section 206(d)(1) of the Federal Credit Union Act. In either case, the state credit union will be entitled to a refund of the federal credit union's NCUSIF capitalization deposit after the final date on which any of its shares are federally insured. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The NCUA Board reserves the right to delay the refund of the capitalization deposit for up to one year if it determines that payment would jeopardize the NCUSIF. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.C—Submission of Conversion Proposal to NCUA </p>

<p class="hd2-paragraph">III.E—Approval of Proposal by Members </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The members may not vote on the proposal until it is approved by the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. Once approval of the proposal is received, the following actions will be taken by the board of directors: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The proposal must be submitted to the members for approval and a date set for a meeting to vote on the proposal.

If the proposed state-chartered credit union will not be federally insured, 20 percent of the total membership must participate in the voting, and of those, a majority must vote in favor of the proposal. Ballots cast by members who did not attend the meeting but who submitted their ballots in accordance with instructions above will be counted with votes cast at the meeting.

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• The credit union shall cease to be a federal credit union as of the effective date of the state charter. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• If the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director finds a material deviation from the provisions that would invalidate any steps taken in the conversion, the credit union and the state regulator shall be promptly notified in writing. This notice may be either before or after the copy of the state charter is filed with the Office of Credit Union Resources and Expansion Director. The notice will inform the credit union as to the nature of the adverse findings. The conversion will not be effective and completed until the improper actions and steps have been corrected. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• Upon ceasing to be a federal credit union, the credit union shall no longer be subject to any of the provisions of the Federal Credit Union Act, except as may apply if federal share insurance coverage is continued. The successor state credit union shall be immediately vested with all of the assets and shall continue to be responsible for all of the obligations of the federal credit union to the same extent as though the conversion had not taken place. Operation of the credit union from this point will be in accordance with the requirements of state law and the state regulator. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• There is no federal requirement for closing the records of the federal credit union at the time of conversion or for the manner in which the records shall be maintained thereafter.
