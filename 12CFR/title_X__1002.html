</div>
<p>The size of the random sample, under column B, shall depend on the size of the financial institution's small business lending application register, as shown in column A of the Threshold Table.  </p>

<p>The thresholds in column C of the Threshold Table reflect the number of unintentional errors a financial institution may make within a particular data field (<em>e.g.,</em> the credit product data field within the credit type data point or the ethnicity data field for a particular principal owner within the ethnicity, race, and sex of principal owners data point) in a small business lending application register that would be deemed bona fide errors for purposes of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.112#p-1002.112(b)" class="cfr external">§ 1002.112(b)</a>. </p>
<p>For instance, a financial institution that submitted a small business lending application register containing 105 applications would be subject to a threshold of three errors per data field. If the financial institution had made two errors in reporting loan amount and two errors reporting gross annual income, all of these errors would be covered by the bona fide error provision of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.112#p-1002.112(b)" class="cfr external">§ 1002.112(b)</a> and would not constitute a violation of the Act or this part. If the same financial institution had made four errors in reporting loan amount and two errors reporting gross annual income, the bona fide error provision of <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.112#p-1002.112(b)" class="cfr external">§ 1002.112(b)</a> would not apply to the four loan amount errors but would still apply to the two gross annual income errors. </p>
<p>Even when the number of errors in a particular data field do not equal or exceed the threshold in column C, if either there is a reasonable basis to believe that errors in that field were intentional or there is evidence that the financial institution did not maintain procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors, then the errors are not bona fide errors under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.112#p-1002.112(b)" class="cfr external">§ 1002.112(b)</a>. </p>
<p>For purposes of determining bona fide errors under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.112#p-1002.112(b)" class="cfr external">§ 1002.112(b)</a>, the term “data field” generally refers to individual fields. Some data fields may allow for more than one response. For example, with respect to information on the ethnicity or race of an applicant's principal owners, a data field may identify more than one race or more than one ethnicity for a given person. If one or more of the ethnicities or races identified in a data field are erroneous, they count as one (and only one) error for that data field. </p>

Forms C–1 through C–4 are intended for use in notifying an applicant that adverse action has been taken on an application or account under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-1002/section-1002.9#p-1002.9(a)(1)" class="cfr external">§§ 1002.9(a)(1)</a> and <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-1002/section-1002.9#p-1002.9(2)(i)" class="cfr external">(2)(i) of this part</a>. Form C–5 is a notice of disclosure of the right to request specific reasons for adverse action under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.9#p-1002.9(a)(1)" class="cfr external">§§ 1002.9(a)(1)</a> and <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.9#p-1002.9(2)(ii)" class="cfr external">(2)(ii)</a>.

Forms C–7 and C–8 are intended for use in connection with applications for business credit under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-1002.9#p-1002.9(a)(3)" class="cfr external">§ 1002.9(a)(3)</a>.

<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-1002(2.)" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-1002 2."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Form C–1 contains the Fair Credit Reporting Act disclosure as required by sections 615(a) and (b) of that act. Forms C–2 through C–5 contain only the section 615(a) disclosure (that a creditor obtained information from a consumer reporting agency that was considered in the credit decision). A creditor must provide the section 615(a) disclosure when adverse action is taken against a consumer based on information from a consumer reporting agency. A creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure when adverse action is taken based on information from an outside source other than a consumer reporting agency. In addition, a creditor must provide the section 615(b) disclosure if the creditor obtained information from an affiliate other than information in a consumer report or other than information concerning the affiliate's own transactions or experiences with the consumer. Creditors may comply with the disclosure requirements for adverse action based on information in a consumer report obtained from an affiliate by providing either the section 615(a) or section 615(b) disclosure. Optional language in Forms C–1 through C–5 may be used to direct the consumer to the entity that provided the credit score for any questions about the credit score, along with the entity's contact information. Creditors may use or not use this additional language without losing the safe harbor, since the language is optional. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-1002(3.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-1002(3.)" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-1002 3."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The sample forms are illustrative and may not be appropriate for all creditors. They were designed to include some of the factors that creditors most commonly consider. If a creditor chooses to use the checklist of reasons provided in one of the sample forms in this appendix and if reasons commonly used by the creditor are not provided on the form, the creditor should modify the checklist by substituting or adding other reasons. For example, if “inadequate down payment” or “no deposit relationship with us” are common reasons for taking adverse action on an application, the creditor ought to add or substitute such reasons for those presently contained on the sample forms. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-1002(4.)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-1002(4.)" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-1002 4."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> If the reasons listed on the forms are not the factors actually used, a creditor will not satisfy the notice requirement by simply checking the closest identifiable factor listed. For example, some creditors consider only references from banks or other depository institutions and disregard finance company references altogether; their statement of reasons should disclose “insufficient bank references,” not “insufficient credit references.” Similarly, a creditor that considers bank references and other credit references as distinct factors should treat the two factors separately and disclose them as appropriate. The creditor should either add such other factors to the form or check “other” and include the appropriate explanation. The creditor need not, however, describe how or why a factor adversely affected the application. For example, the notice may say “length of residence” rather than “too short a period of residence.” </p>

This could be done, for example, by analyzing the loan portfolio to determine the delinquency rate for each score interval, or by analyzing population stability over time to detect deviations of recent applications from the applicant population used to validate the system. If this analysis indicates that the system no longer predicts risk with statistical soundness, the system must be adjusted as necessary to reestablish its predictive ability.

In cases where a credit scoring system is used in conjunction with individual discretion, disparate treatment could conceivably occur in the evaluation process.

Congressional intent that this doctrine apply to the credit area is documented in the Senate Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94–589, pp. 4–5; and in the House Report that accompanied H.R. 6516, No. 94–210, p.5. The Act and regulation may prohibit a creditor practice that is discriminatory in effect because it has a disproportionately negative impact on a prohibited basis, even though the creditor has no intent to discriminate and the practice appears neutral on its face, unless the creditor practice meets a legitimate business need that cannot reasonably be achieved as well by means that are less disparate in their impact. For example, requiring that applicants have income in excess of a certain amount to qualify for an overdraft line of credit could mean that women and minority applicants will be rejected at a higher rate than men and nonminority applicants. If there is a demonstrable relationship between the income requirement and creditworthiness for the level of credit involved, however, use of the income standard would likely be permissible. </p>

A second card may cover all other applicants, who are evaluated under the attributes predictive for that broader class. When a system uses a card covering a wide age range that encompasses elderly applicants, the credit scoring system is not deemed to score age. Thus, the system does not raise the issue of assigning a negative factor or value to the age of elderly applicants.

A creditor may require the personal guarantee of the partners, directors, or officers of a business, and the shareholders of a closely held corporation, even if the business or corporation is creditworthy. The requirement must be based on the guarantor's relationship with the business or corporation, however, and not on a prohibited basis. For example, a creditor may not require guarantees only for women-owned or minority-owned businesses. Similarly, a creditor may not require guarantees only of the married officers of a business or the married shareholders of a closely held corporation. </p>

If an evaluation of the financial circumstances of an officer indicates that an additional signature is necessary, however, the creditor may require the signature of another person in appropriate circumstances in accordance with § 1002.7(d)(2). </p>

On the other hand, a creditor has treated a request as an application, and is subject to the adverse action notice requirements of § 1002.9 if, after evaluating information, the creditor decides that it will not approve the request and communicates that decision to the consumer.

If the application passes the credit scoring stage but the creditor then denies the credit request based on a judgmental assessment of the applicant's record, the reasons disclosed must relate to the factors reviewed judgmentally, even if the factors were also considered in the credit scoring component. If the application is not approved or denied as a result of the credit scoring, but falls into a gray band, and the creditor performs a judgmental assessment and denies the credit after that assessment, the reasons disclosed must come from both components of the system.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) requires a creditor to disclose when it has based its decision in whole or in part on information from a source other than the applicant or its own files. Disclosing that a credit report was obtained and used in the denial of the application, as the FCRA requires, does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons. For example, if the applicant's credit history reveals delinquent credit obligations and the application is denied for that reason, to satisfy § 1002.9(b)(2) the creditor must disclose that the application was denied because of the applicant's delinquent credit obligations. The FCRA also requires a creditor to disclose, as applicable, a credit score it used in taking adverse action along with related information, including up to four key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score (or up to five factors if the number of inquiries made with respect to that consumer report is a key factor). Disclosing the key factors that adversely affected the consumer's credit score does not satisfy the ECOA requirement to disclose specific reasons for denying or taking other adverse action on an application or extension of credit. Sample forms C–1 through C–5 of appendix C of the regulation provide for both the ECOA and FCRA disclosures. See also comment 9(b)(2)–1. </p>

<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(a)(2) Corrective action required.</em> </p>
<p>1. To qualify for the privilege, appropriate corrective action is required when the results of a self-test show that it is more likely than not that there has been a violation of the ECOA or this part. A self-test is also privileged when it identifies no violations. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-1002(3.)(vi.)(2.)">

This would not necessarily prevent a creditor from asserting the privilege. In situations where the self-test is not complete, for the privilege to apply the lender must satisfy the regulation's requirements within a reasonable period of time. To assert the privilege where the self-test shows a likely violation, the rule requires, at a minimum, that the creditor establish a plan for corrective action and a method to demonstrate progress in implementing the plan. Creditors must take appropriate corrective action on a timely basis after the results of the self-test are known. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-1002(3.)(vi.)(3.)">

Self-testing data may be privileged under this section whether or not the creditor's assertion of another privilege is upheld. </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(b) Self-test defined.</em> </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(b)(1) Definition.</em> </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Paragraph 15(b)(1)(i).</em> </p>
<p>1. To qualify for the privilege, a self-test must be sufficient to constitute a determination of the extent or effectiveness of the creditor's compliance with the Act and Regulation B. Accordingly, a self-test is only privileged if it was designed and used for that purpose. A self-test that is designed or used to determine compliance with other laws or regulations or for other purposes is not privileged under this rule. For example, a self-test designed to evaluate employee efficiency or customers' satisfaction with the level of service provided by the creditor is not privileged even if evidence of discrimination is uncovered incidentally. If a self-test is designed for multiple purposes, only the portion designed to determine compliance with the ECOA is eligible for the privilege. </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Paragraph 15(b)(1)(ii).</em> </p>
<p>1. The principal attribute of self-testing is that it constitutes a voluntary undertaking by the creditor to produce new data or factual information that otherwise would not be available and could not be derived from loan or application files or other records related to credit transactions. Self-testing includes, but is not limited to, the practice of using fictitious applicants for credit (testers), either with or without the use of matched pairs. A creditor may elect to test a defined segment of its business, for example, loan applications processed by a specific branch or loan officer, or applications made for a particular type of credit or loan program. A creditor also may use other methods of generating information that is not available in loan and application files, such as surveying mortgage loan applicants. To the extent permitted by law, creditors might also develop new methods that go beyond traditional pre-application testing, such as hiring testers to submit fictitious loan applications for processing. </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-1002(3.)(vi.)(2.)">
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-1002(3.)(vi.)(2.)" data-title="Supplement-I-to-Part-1002 3.vi.2."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The privilege does not protect a creditor's analysis performed as part of processing or underwriting a credit application. A creditor's evaluation or analysis of its loan files, Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, or similar types of records (such as broker or loan officer compensation records) does not produce new information about a creditor's compliance and is not a self-test for purposes of this section. Similarly, a statistical analysis of data derived from existing loan files is not privileged. </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(b)(3) Types of information not privileged.</em> </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Paragraph 15(b)(3)(i).</em> </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Supplement-I-to-Part-1002(3.)(vi.)(1.)">

Accordingly, a creditor might be asked to identify the self-testing method, for example, whether preapplication testers were used or data were compiled by surveying loan applicants. Information about the scope of the self-test (such as the types of credit transactions examined, or the geographic area covered by the test) also is not privileged. </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Paragraph 15(b)(3)(ii).</em> </p>
<p>1. Property appraisal reports, minutes of loan committee meetings or other documents reflecting the basis for a decision to approve or deny an application, loan policies or procedures, underwriting standards, and broker compensation records are examples of the types of records that are not privileged. If a creditor arranges for testers to submit loan applications for processing, the records are not related to actual credit transactions for purposes of this paragraph and may be privileged self-testing records. </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(c) Appropriate corrective action.</em> </p>
<p>1. The rule only addresses the corrective actions required for a creditor to take advantage of the privilege in this section. A creditor may be required to take other actions or provide additional relief if a formal finding of discrimination is made. </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(c)(1) General requirement.</em> </p>
<p>1. Appropriate corrective action is required even though no violation has been formally adjudicated or admitted by the creditor. In determining whether it is more likely than not that a violation occurred, a creditor must treat testers as if they are actual applicants for credit. A creditor may not refuse to take appropriate corrective action under this section because the self-test used fictitious loan applicants. The fact that a tester's agreement with the creditor waives the tester's legal right to assert a violation does not eliminate the requirement for the creditor to take corrective action, although no remedial relief for the tester is required under paragraph 15(c)(3). </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(c)(2) Determining the scope of appropriate corrective action.</em> </p>
<p>1. Whether a creditor has taken or is taking corrective action that is appropriate will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Generally, the scope of the corrective action that is needed to preserve the privilege is governed by the scope of the self-test. For example, a creditor that self-tests mortgage loans and discovers evidence of discrimination may focus its corrective actions on mortgage loans, and is not required to expand its testing to other types of loans. </p>

<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(d)(1) Scope of privilege.</em> </p>
<p>1. The privilege applies with respect to any examination, investigation or proceeding by Federal, State, or local government agencies relating to compliance with the Act or this part. Accordingly, in a case brought under the ECOA, the privilege established under this section preempts any inconsistent laws or court rules to the extent they might require disclosure of privileged self-testing data. The privilege does not apply in other cases (such as in litigation filed solely under a State's fair lending statute). In such cases, if a court orders a creditor to disclose self-test results, the disclosure is not a voluntary disclosure or waiver of the privilege for purposes of paragraph 15(d)(2); a creditor may protect the information by seeking a protective order to limit availability and use of the self-testing data and prevent dissemination beyond what is necessary in that case. Paragraph 15(d)(1) precludes a party who has obtained privileged information from using it in a case brought under the ECOA, provided the creditor has not lost the privilege through voluntary disclosure under paragraph 15(d)(2). </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">15(d)(2) Loss of privilege.</em> </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Paragraph 15(d)(2)(i).</em> </p>
<p>1. A creditor's corrective action, by itself, is not considered a voluntary disclosure of the self-test report or results. For example, a creditor does not disclose the results of a self-test merely by offering to extend credit to a denied applicant or by inviting the applicant to reapply for credit. Voluntary disclosure could occur under this paragraph, however, if the creditor disclosed the self-test results in connection with a new offer of credit. </p>

Entities, such as trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies, and corporations, are not principal owners for this purpose. Additionally, an individual must directly own an equity share of 25 percent or more in the business in order to be a principal owner.

Thus, when determining who is a principal owner, ownership is not traced through multiple corporate structures to determine if an individual owns 25 percent or more of the equity interests. For example, if individual A directly owns 20 percent of a business, individual B directly owns 20 percent, and partnership C owns 60 percent, the business does not have any owners who satisfy the definition of principal owner set forth in § 1002.102(o), even if individual A and individual B are the only partners in the partnership C.

Whether a particular request is a covered application, or whether instead it is an inquiry or prequalification request that is not reportable under subpart B, may turn, for instance, on how a financial institution structures and processes such requests: does the financial institution require or encourage a preliminary review in order for a business to be considered for a covered credit transaction, or does the business voluntarily seek preliminary feedback as a tool to explore its options before it decides whether to apply for credit with the financial institution? The name used by the financial institution for such a request is not determinative. For example, under subpart B, a review is a reportable covered application if the financial institution requires the business, before it may apply for credit, to pass through a mandatory screening process that considers particular information about the business and denies or turns away the business if it is ineligible or unlikely to qualify for credit. In contrast, a business that requests a financial institution to identify credit products for which the business might qualify based on limited or self-described characteristics, and without any commitment from the financial institution to extend credit, may not have submitted a covered application for purposes of subpart B. </p>

The first time such an adjustment could occur is in 2030, with an effective date of January 1, 2031. A financial institution seeking to determine whether it is a covered financial institution applies the gross annual revenue threshold that is in effect for each year it is evaluating. For example, a financial institution seeking to determine whether it is a covered financial institution in 2032 counts its originations of covered credit transactions for small businesses in calendar years 2030 and 2031. The financial institution applies the initial $5 million threshold to evaluate whether its originations were to small businesses in 2030. In this example, if the small business threshold were increased to $5.5 million effective January 1, 2031, the financial institution applies the $5.5 million threshold to count its originations for small businesses in 2031. </p>

In addition, transactions that extend, renew, or otherwise amend a transaction are not counted as originations. For example, if a financial institution originates 50 term loans and 30 lines of credit for small businesses in each of the preceding two calendar years, along with 25 line increases for small businesses in each of those years, the financial institution is not a covered financial institution because it has not originated at least 100 covered credit transactions in each of the two preceding calendar years. </p>

The base for computing each adjustment is the January 2025 CPI–U; this base value shall be compared to the CPI–U value in January 2030 and every five years thereafter. For example, after the January 2030 CPI–U is made available, the adjustment is calculated by determining the percentage change in the CPI–U between January 2025 and January 2030, applying this change to the $5 million gross annual revenue threshold, and rounding to the nearest $500,000. If, as a result of this rounding, there is no change in the gross annual revenue threshold, there will be no adjustment. For example, if in January 2030 the adjusted value were $4.9 million (reflecting a $100,000 decrease from January 2025 CPI–U), then the threshold would not adjust because $4.9 million would be rounded up to $5 million.

The loan term is the number of months after which the legal obligation will mature or terminate, measured from the date of origination. For transactions involving real property, the financial institution may instead measure the loan term from the date of the first payment period and disregard the time that elapses, if any, between the settlement of the transaction and the first payment period. For example, if a loan closes on April 12, but the first payment is not due until June 1 and includes the interest accrued in May (but not April), the financial institution may choose not to include the month of April in the loan term. In addition, the financial institution may round the loan term to the nearest full month or may count only full months and ignore partial months, as it so chooses. If a credit product, such as a credit card, does not have a loan term, the financial institution reports that the loan term is “not applicable.” The financial institution also reports that the loan term is “not applicable” if the credit product is reported as “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.” For a credit product that generally has a loan term, the financial institution reports “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined” if the application is denied, withdrawn, or determined to be incomplete before a loan term has been identified. For merchant cash advances and other sales-based financing transactions, the financial institution complies with § 1002.107(a)(5)(iii) by reporting the loan term, if any, that the financial institution estimated or specified in processing, underwriting or providing disclosures for the application or transaction. If more than one such loan term is estimated or specified, the financial institution reports the one it considers to be most accurate, in its discretion. For merchant cash advances and other sales-based financing transactions that do not have a loan term, the financial institution reports “not provided by applicant and otherwise undetermined.” </p>

The terms of the transaction state that if the applicant prepays the principal before the 12-month period is over, the applicant is responsible for paying the difference between $24,000 and the amount the applicant has already repaid prior to initiating prepayment. The difference between the $24,000 to be repaid and what the applicant has already repaid prior to initiating prepayment is a balloon finance charge and should be reported as a prepayment penalty. </p>

If an applicant chooses to provide the name of an enrolled or principal tribe, a financial institution must report that information via free-form text in the appropriate data reporting field. If the applicant provides the name of an enrolled or principal tribe but does not also indicate that the principal owner is American Indian or Alaska Native (<em>e.g.,</em> by selecting American Indian or Alaska Native on a paper or electronic form), a financial institution is permitted, but not required, to report American Indian or Alaska Native as well. </p>

A financial institution must permit an applicant to select one or more disaggregated subcategories even if the applicant does not select an aggregate category. For example, an applicant must be permitted to select the Chinese disaggregated subcategory for a principal owner without being required to select the Asian aggregate category. If an applicant provides race information for a principal owner, the financial institution reports all of the aggregate categories and disaggregated subcategories provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant selects two aggregate categories and five disaggregated subcategories for a principal owner, the financial institution reports the two aggregate categories that the applicant selected and the five disaggregated subcategories that the applicant selected. Additionally, if an applicant selects only the Chinese disaggregated subcategory for a principal owner, the financial institution reports Chinese for the race of the principal owner but does not also report that the principal owner is Asian. Similarly, if the applicant selects an aggregate category (<em>e.g.,</em> Asian) and a disaggregated subcategory that does not correspond to the aggregate category (<em>e.g.,</em> Native Hawaiian), the financial institution reports the information as provided by the applicant (<em>e.g.,</em> Asian and Native Hawaiian). </p>

For example, in an electronic application, a financial institution may require the applicant to either make a substantive selection about a principal owner's ethnicity, race, or sex, select an option of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar, or indicate there are no principal owners before allowing the applicant to proceed to the next page of requested information. </p>

Conversely, a financial institution must avoid imposing unnecessary burden on an applicant to provide the information requested or requiring the applicant to take steps that are inconsistent with the rest of its application process. For example, a financial institution does not have reasonably designed procedures if it collects application information related to its own creditworthiness determination in electronic form, but mails a paper form to the applicant initially seeking the data required under § 1002.107(a) that the financial institution does not otherwise need for its creditworthiness determination and requiring the applicant to mail it back.

In general, these include monitoring for low response rates (<em>i.e.,</em> the percentage of covered applications for which the financial institution has obtained some type of response to requests for applicant-provided data, including, as applicable, an applicant response of “I do not wish to provide this information” or similar); monitoring for significant irregularities in any particular response that may indicate steering, improper interference, or other potential discouragement or obstruction of applicants' preferred responses; monitoring response rates and responses by division, location, loan officer, or other factors to ensure that no discouragement or improper conduct is occurring in some parts of a financial institution, even if the financial institution maintains adequate response rates and responses overall; providing adequate training to loan officers and other persons involved in collecting applicant-provided data; promptly investigating any indicia of potential discouragement; and taking prompt remedial action if discouragement or other improper conduct is identified. </p>

A response rate may be measured, as appropriate, as compared to financial institutions of a similar size, type, and/or geographic reach, or other factors, as appropriate.

For example, if a business notifies a financial institution of a change of address of its sole business location, and subsequently submits a covered application within the time period specified in § 1002.107(d)(1) for reusing previously collected data, the financial institution must report census tract based on the updated information.

This includes, but is not limited to, employees and officers serving as underwriters. The decision that an employee or officer makes or participates in must be about a specific covered application or about the creditworthiness of a specific applicant. An employee or officer is not involved in making a determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer is only involved in making a decision that affects covered applications generally, or if the employee or officer only interacts with small businesses prior to them becoming applicants or submitting an application. An employee or officer may be participating in a determination concerning a covered application even if the employee or officer is not the ultimate decision maker or the sole decision maker. For example, an employee participates in a determination concerning a covered application if the employee recommends that another employee or officer approve or deny the application. Similarly, an employee or officer participates in a determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer is part of a larger group, such as a committee, that makes a determination concerning a covered application. For example, an employee participates in a decision if the employee is a member of a committee that approves the terms offered to an applicant for a covered application. This is true even if the employee does not support the committee's ultimate decision regarding the terms offered. Conversely, an employee or officer does not participate in a determination concerning a covered application if the employee or officer only performs ministerial functions for the committee, such as recording the minutes, or if the committee does not make a determination concerning a specific covered application. </p>

Additionally, a financial institution may consider its current or its reasonably anticipated staffing levels, operations, systems, processes, policies, and procedures.

Additionally, an employee or officer who knows that an applicant is a minority-owned business, women-owned business, or LGBTQI+-owned business, or who knows the ethnicity, race, or sex of any of the applicant's principal owners due to activities unrelated to the inquiries made to satisfy the financial institution's obligations under § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19) is not prohibited from making a determination concerning the applicant's covered application. Thus, an employee or officer who knows, for example, that an applicant is a minority-owned business due to a social relationship or another professional relationship with the applicant or any of its principal owners may make determinations concerning the applicant's covered application. Furthermore, an employee or officer that is involved in making a determination concerning a covered application may see, consider, refer to, or use data collected to satisfy aspects of § 1002.107 other than § 1002.107(a)(18) or (19), such as gross annual revenue, number of workers, and time in business. </p>

A financial institution is not required to perform a separate analysis of the feasibility of maintaining a firewall. A determination that an employee or officer should have access means that it is not feasible to maintain a firewall as to that particular employee or officer, and the exception applies to that employee or officer if the financial institution provides the notice required by § 1002.108(d). However, the fact that a financial institution has made a determination that an employee or officer should have access does not mean that the financial institution can permit other employees and officers who are involved in making determinations concerning a covered application to have access to the information collected pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19). A financial institution may only permit an employee or officer who is involved in making a determination concerning a covered application to have access to information collected pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19) if it has determined that employee or officer or a group of which the employee or officer is a member should have access to the information. </p>

A financial institution can also determine that several employees and officers should have access, that all of a group of similarly situated employees or officers should have access, and that multiple groups of similarly situated employees or officers should have access to information collected pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) or (19). See also comment 108(a)–2. For example, a financial institution could determine that all its small business loan officers, small business loan processors, compliance officers, and legal officers should have access. If the financial institution provides the notice required in § 1002.108(d), the financial institution may permit all of its small business loan officers, small business loan processors, compliance officers, and legal officers to have access. However, the financial institution cannot permit other employees and officers to have access simply because it has determined that the small business loan officers, loan processors, compliance officers, and legal officers should have access. For example, in this case, the financial institution may not permit its underwriters or chief executive officer to have access to the information collected from the applicant pursuant to § 1002.107(a)(18) or (19) if they are involved in making any determination concerning a covered application, unless the financial institution also determines that they should have access. This would be true even if the chief executive officer or underwriter had some of the same assigned duties as a loan officer, such as being a member of a credit committee, but has not been assigned the task(s) that may require access to one or more applicants' responses to the financial institution's inquiries under § 1002.107(a)(18) or (19).

Setting the material terms of the covered credit transaction include, for example, selecting among competing offers, or modifying pricing information, amount approved or originated, or repayment duration. In this situation, the determinative factor is not which financial institution actually made the last credit decision prior to closing, but rather which financial institution last had the authority for setting the material terms of the covered credit transaction prior to closing. Whether a financial institution has taken action for purposes of § 1002.109(a)(3) and comment 109(a)(3)–1 is not relevant to, and is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with, section 701(d) (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/15/1691" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">15 U.S.C. 1691(d)</a>) of the Act, § 1002.9, or any other provision within subpart A of this Regulation. </p>

For reporting purposes, it is not relevant whether the financial institution receives the application directly from the applicant or indirectly through another party, such as a broker, or (except as otherwise provided in comment 109(a)(3)–1.i) whether another financial institution also reviews and reports an action taken on a covered application involving the same credit transaction. </p>

For example, Financial Institution A is the reporting entity because it has the last authority to set the material credit terms. Financial Institution A sends the application to Financial Institution B and Financial Institution C for review, but both Financial Institution B and Financial Institution C deny the application, with different denial reasons.

The Bureau's thresholds appear in column C of the table in appendix F.

Some data fields may allow for more than one response. For example, with respect to information on the ethnicity and race of an applicant's principal owner, a data field may identify more than one race or ethnicity. If there are one or more errors within an ethnicity data field, or within a race data field, for a particular principal owner, they would count as one (and only one) error for that data field. For instance, in the ethnicity data field, if an applicant indicates that one of its principal owners is Cuban, but the financial institution reports that the principal owner is Mexican and Puerto Rican, the financial institution has made one error in the ethnicity data field for that principal owner. For purposes of the error threshold table in appendix F, the financial institution is deemed to have made one error, not two. </p>

Specifically, to qualify for this safe harbor, § 1002.112(c)(4) requires that the financial institution have had a reasonable basis at the time it collected data under § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19) for believing that the application was a covered application for a covered credit transaction from a small business pursuant to §§ 1002.103, 1002.104, and 1002.106, respectively. For example, Financial Institution A collected data under § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19) from an applicant for a covered credit transaction that had self-reported its gross annual revenue as $4.8 million. Sometime after Financial Institution A had collected this data from the applicant, the financial institution reviewed the applicant's tax returns, which indicated the applicant's gross annual revenue was in fact $5.2 million. Financial Institution A is permitted to rely on representations made by the applicant regarding gross annual revenue in determining whether an applicant is a small business (see § 1002.107(b) and comments 106(b)(1)–3 and 107(a)(14)–1). Thus, Financial Institution A may have had a reasonable basis to believe, at the time it collected data under § 1002.107(a)(18) and (19), that the applicant was a small business pursuant to § 1002.106, in which case Financial Institution A's collection of such data would not violate the Act or this regulation. </p>

Financial Institution F determined that it had originated 80 total covered credit transactions for businesses in 2022 and 150 total covered credit transactions for businesses in 2023. Applying the methodology set out in comment 114(c)–5.ii, Financial Institution F assumed that all such transactions originated in 2022 and 2023 were originated for small businesses. On that basis, Financial Institution E is not in Tier 1, Tier 2 or Tier 3, and is subject to the compliance date provision specified in § 1002.114(b)(4). </p>
