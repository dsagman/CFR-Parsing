<p>The effect of the provisions of subpart C may be varied by agreement, except that no agreement can disclaim the responsibility of a bank for its own lack of good faith or failure to exercise ordinary care, or can limit the measure of damages for such lack or failure; but the parties may determine by agreement the standards by which such responsibility is to be measured if such standards are not manifestly unreasonable. </p>

A bank that fails to exercise ordinary care or act in good faith under this subpart may be liable to the depositary bank, the depositary bank's customer, the owner of a check, or another party to the check.

A bank that fails to act in good faith under this subpart may be liable for other damages, if any, suffered by the party as a proximate consequence.

The routing number takes two forms: a fractional form and a nine-digit form. A paying bank generally is identified on the face of a check by its routing number in both the fractional form (which generally appears in the upper right-hand corner of the check) and the nine-digit form (which is printed in magnetic ink along the bottom of the check). Where a check is payable by one bank but payable through another bank, the routing number appearing on the check is that of the payable-through bank, not the payor bank. </p>

<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-229(B.)" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-229 B."><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">B<span class="paren">.</span></span> The first four digits of the nine-digit routing number (and the denominator of the fractional routing number) form the “Federal Reserve routing symbol,” and the first two digits of the routing number identify the Federal Reserve District in which the bank is located. Thus, 01 will be the first two digits of the routing number of a bank in the First Federal Reserve District (Boston), and 12 will be the first two digits of the routing number of a bank in the Twelfth District (San Francisco). Adding 2 to the first digit denotes a thrift institution. Thus, 21 identifies a thrift in the First District, and 32 denotes a thrift in the Twelfth District. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Your Ability To Withdraw Funds </p>
<p>Our policy is to make funds from your cash and check deposits available to you on the first business day after the day we receive your deposit. Electronic direct deposits will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Once the funds are available, you can withdraw them in cash and we will use them to pay checks that you have written. </p>
<p>For determining the availability of your deposits, every day is a business day, except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If you make a deposit before (<em>time of day</em>) on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after (<em>time of day</em>) or on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day we are open. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Longer Delays May Apply </p>
<p>Funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances: </p>
<p>• We believe a check you deposit will not be paid. </p>
<p>• You deposit checks totaling more than $5,000 on any one day. </p>
<p>• You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid. </p>
<p>• You have overdrawn your account repeatedly in the last six months. </p>
<p>• There is an emergency, such as failure of computer or communications equipment. </p>
<p>We will notify you if we delay your ability to withdraw funds for any of these reasons, and we will tell you when the funds will be available. They will generally be available no later than the (<em>number</em>) business day after the day of your deposit. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Special Rules for New Accounts </p>
<p>If you are a new customer, the following special rules will apply during the first 30 days your account is open. </p>
<p>Funds from electronic direct deposits to your account will be available on the day we receive the deposit. Funds from deposits of cash, wire transfers, and the first $5,000 of a day's total deposits of cashier's, certified, teller's, traveler's, and federal, state and local government checks will be available on the first business day after the day of your deposit if the deposit meets certain conditions. For example, the checks must be payable to you (and you may have to use a special deposit slip). The excess over $5,000 will be available on the ninth business day after the day of your deposit. If your deposit of these checks (other than a U.S. Treasury check) is not made in person to one of our employees, the first $5,000 will not be available until the second business day after the day of your deposit. </p>
<p>Funds from all other check deposits will be available on the (<em>number</em>) business day after the day of your deposit. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Longer Delays May Apply </p>
<p>In some cases, we will not make all of the funds that you deposit by check available to you on the first business day after the day of your deposit. Depending on the type of check that you deposit, funds may not be available until the fifth business day after the day of your deposit. The first $100 of your deposits, however, may be available on the first business day. </p>
<p>If we are not going to make all of the funds from your deposit available on the first business day, we will notify you at the time you make your deposit. We will also tell you when the funds will be available. If your deposit is not made directly to one of our employees, or if we decide to take this action after you have left the premises, we will mail you the notice by the day after we receive your deposit. </p>
<p>If you will need the funds from a deposit right away, you should ask us when the funds will be available. </p>
<p>In addition, funds you deposit by check may be delayed for a longer period under the following circumstances: </p>
<p>• We believe a check you deposit will not be paid. </p>
<p>• You deposit checks totaling more than $5,000 on any one day. </p>
<p>• You redeposit a check that has been returned unpaid. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Your Ability To Withdraw Funds </p>
<p>Our policy is to delay the availability of funds from your cash and check deposits. During the delay, you may not withdraw the funds in cash and we will not use the funds to pay checks that you have written. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Determining the Availability of a Deposit </p>
<p>The length of the delay is counted in business days from the day of your deposit. Every day is a business day except Saturdays, Sundays, and federal holidays. If you make a deposit before (<em>time of day</em>) on a business day that we are open, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if you make a deposit after (<em>time of day</em>) or on a day we are not open, we will consider that the deposit was made on the next business day we are open. </p>
<p>The length of the delay varies depending on the type of deposit and is explained below. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Same-Day Availability </p>
<p>Funds from electronic direct deposits to your account will be available on the day we receive the deposit. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Next-Day Availability </p>
<p>Funds from the following deposits are available on the first business day after the day of your deposit: </p>
<p>• U.S. Treasury checks that are payable to you. </p>
<p>• Wire transfers. </p>
<p>• Checks drawn on (<em>bank name</em>) [unless (<em>any limitations related to branches in different states or check processing regions</em>)]. </p>
<p>If you make the deposit in person to one of our employees, funds from the following deposits are also available on the first business day after the day of your deposit: </p>
<p>• Cash. </p>
<p>• State and local government checks that are payable to you [if you use a special deposit slip available from (<em>where deposit slip may be obtained</em>)]. </p>
<p>• Cashier's, certified, and teller's checks that are payable to you [if you use a special deposit slip available from (<em>where deposit slip may be obtained</em>)]. </p>
<p>• Federal Reserve Bank checks, Federal Home Loan Bank checks, and postal money orders, if these items are payable to you. </p>
<p>If you do not make your deposit in person to one of our employees (for example, if you mail the deposit), funds from these deposits will be available on the second business day after the day we receive your deposit. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Other Check Deposits </p>
<p>To find out when funds from other check deposits will be available, look at the first four digits of the routing number on the check: </p>
<a href="https://img.federalregister.gov/ER24MR97.000/ER24MR97.000_original_size.png"><img src="https://img.federalregister.gov/ER24MR97.000/ER24MR97.000_large.png" loading="lazy" style="height: 652px; width: 823px;"></a>
<p>Some checks are marked “payable through” and have a four-or nine-digit number nearby. For these checks, use this four-digit number (or the first four digits of the nine-digit number), not the routing number on the bottom of the check, to determine if these checks are local or nonlocal. Once you have determined the first four digits of the routing number (1234 in the examples above), the following chart will show you when funds from the check will be available: </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Other Check Deposits </p>

<a href="https://img.federalregister.gov/ER17SE97.000/ER17SE97.000_original_size.png"><img src="https://img.federalregister.gov/ER17SE97.000/ER17SE97.000_large.png" loading="lazy" style="height: 864px; width: 823px;"></a>
<p>If the first four digits of the routing number (1234 in the examples above) are (<em>list of local numbers</em>), then the check is a local check. Otherwise, the check is a nonlocal check. Some checks are marked “payable through” and have a four- or nine-digit number nearby. For these checks, use the four-digit number (or the first four digits of the nine-digit number), not the routing number on the bottom of the check, to determine if these checks are local or nonlocal.

<p class="hd3-paragraph">C–5A—Substitute Check Policy Disclosure </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Substitute Checks and Your Rights—[Important Information About Your Checking Account] </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Substitute Checks and Your Rights </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">What Is a Substitute Check? </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">To make check processing faster, federal law permits banks to replace original checks with “substitute checks.” These checks are similar in size to original checks with a slightly reduced image of the front and back of the original check. The front of a substitute check states: “This is a legal copy of your check. You can use it the same way you would use the original check.” You may use a substitute check as proof of payment just like the original check. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Some or all of the checks that you receive back from us may be substitute checks. This notice describes rights you have when you receive substitute checks from us. The rights in this notice do not apply to original checks or to electronic debits to your account. However, you have rights under other law with respect to those transactions. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">What Are My Rights Regarding Substitute Checks? </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In certain cases, federal law provides a special procedure that allows you to request a refund for losses you suffer if a substitute check is posted to your account (for example, if you think that we withdrew the wrong amount from your account or that we withdrew money from your account more than once for the same check). The losses you may attempt to recover under this procedure may include the amount that was withdrawn from your account and fees that were charged as a result of the withdrawal (for example, bounced check fees). </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The amount of your refund under this procedure is limited to the amount of your loss or the amount of the substitute check, whichever is less. You also are entitled to interest on the amount of your refund if your account is an interest-bearing account. If your loss exceeds the amount of the substitute check, you may be able to recover additional amounts under other law. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If you use this procedure, you may receive up to (<em>amount, not lower than $2,500</em>) of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) within (<em>number of days, not more than 10</em>) business days after we received your claim and the remainder of your refund (plus interest if your account earns interest) not later than (<em>number of days, not more than 45</em>) calendar days after we received your claim. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">We may reverse the refund (including any interest on the refund) if we later are able to demonstrate that the substitute check was correctly posted to your account. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">How Do I Make a Claim for a Refund? </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">If you believe that you have suffered a loss relating to a substitute check that you received and that was posted to your account, please contact us at (<em>contact information, for example phone number, mailing address, e-mail address</em>). You must contact us within (<em>number of days, not less than 40</em>) calendar days of the date that we mailed (or otherwise delivered by a means to which you agreed) the substitute check in question or the account statement showing that the substitute check was posted to your account, whichever is later. We will extend this time period if you were not able to make a timely claim because of extraordinary circumstances. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Your claim must include— </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A description of why you have suffered a loss (for example, you think the amount withdrawn was incorrect); </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• An estimate of the amount of your loss; </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• An explanation of why the substitute check you received is insufficient to confirm that you suffered a loss; and </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">• A copy of the substitute check [and/or] the following information to help us identify the substitute check: (<em>identifying information, for example the check number, the name of the person to whom you wrote the check, the amount of the check</em>). </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Model Clauses </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The Board interpretations, which are labeled “Commentary” and follow each section of Regulation CC (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-229" class="cfr external">12 CFR Part 229</a>), provide background material to explain the Board's intent in adopting a particular part of the regulation; the Commentary also provides examples to aid in understanding how a particular requirement is to work. Under section 611(e) of the Expedited Funds Availability Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4010" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 4010(e)</a>), no provision of section 611 imposing any liability shall apply to any act done or omitted in good faith conformity with any rule, regulation, or interpretation thereof by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, notwithstanding the fact that after such act or omission has occurred, such rule, regulation, or interpretation is amended, rescinded, or determined by judicial or other authority to be invalid for any reason. The Commentary is an “interpretation” of a regulation by the Board within the meaning of section 611. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">II. Section 229.2 Definitions </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(A.)">A. Background </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Section 229.2 defines the terms used in the regulation. For the most part, terms are defined as they are in section 602 of the Expedited Funds Availability Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4001" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 4001</a>). The Board has made a number of changes for the sake of clarity, to conform the terminology to that which is familiar to the banking industry, to define terms that are not defined in the EFA Act, and to carry out the purposes of the EFA Act. The Board also has incorporated by reference the definitions of the Uniform Commercial Code where appropriate. Some of Regulation CC's definitions are self-explanatory and therefore are not discussed in this Commentary. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(B.)">B. 229.2(a) Account </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(B.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act defines account to mean “a demand deposit account or similar transaction account at a depository institution.” The regulation defines account, for purposes other than subpart D, in terms of the definition of “transaction account” in the Board's Regulation D (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-204" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 204</a>). This definition of account, however, excludes certain deposits, such as nondocumentary obligations (see <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-204.2#p-204.2(a)(1)(vii)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 204.2(a)(1)(vii)</a>), that are covered under the definition of “transaction account” in Regulation D. The definition applies to accounts with general third party payment powers but does not cover time deposits or savings deposits, including money market deposit accounts, even though they may have limited third party payment powers. The Board believes that it is appropriate to exclude these accounts because of the reference to demand deposits in the EFA Act, which suggests that the EFA Act is intended to apply only to accounts that permit unlimited third party transfers. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(B.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The term account also differs from the definition of transaction account in Regulation D because the term account refers to accounts held at banks. Under Subparts A and C, the term bank includes not only any depository institution, as defined in the EFA Act, but also any person engaged in the business of banking, such as a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or a private banker that is not subject to Regulation D. Thus, accounts at these institutions benefit from the expeditious return requirements of Subpart C. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(B.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> Interbank deposits, including accounts of offices of domestic banks or foreign banks located outside the United States, and direct and indirect accounts of the United States Treasury (including Treasury General Accounts and Treasury Tax and Loan deposits) are exempt from subpart B and, in connection therewith, subpart A. However, interbank deposits are included as accounts for purposes of subparts C and D and, in connection therewith, subpart A. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(B.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> The Check 21 Act defines account to mean any deposit account at a bank. Therefore, for purposes of subpart D and, in connection therewith, subpart A, account means any deposit, as that term is defined by <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-204.2#p-204.2(a)(1)(i)" class="cfr external">§ 204.2(a)(1)(i)</a> of Regulation D, at a bank. Many deposits that are not accounts for purposes of the other subparts of Regulation CC, such as savings deposits, are accounts for purposes of subpart D. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(C.)">C. 229.2(b) Automated Clearinghouse (ACH) </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The Board has defined automated clearinghouse as a facility that processes debit and credit transfers under rules established by a Federal Reserve Bank operating circular governing automated clearinghouse items or the rules of an ACH association. ACH credit transfers are included in the definition of electronic payment. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(C.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The reference to “debit and credit transfers” does not refer to the corresponding debit and credit entries that are part of the same transaction, but to different kinds of ACH payments. In an ACH credit transfer, the originator orders that its account be debited and another account credited. In an ACH debit transfer, the originator, with prior authorization, orders another account to be debited and the originator's account to be credited. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(C.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> A facility that handles only wire transfers (defined elsewhere) is not an ACH. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(D.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> ATM is not defined in the EFA Act. The regulation defines an ATM as an electronic device located in the United States at which a natural person may make deposits to an account by cash or check and perform other account transactions. Point-of-sale terminals, machines that only dispense cash, night depositories, and lobby deposit boxes are not ATMs within the meaning of the definition, either because they do not accept deposits of cash or checks (<em>e.g.,</em> point-of-sale terminals and cash dispensers) or because they only accept deposits (<em>e.g.,</em> night depositories and lobby boxes) and cannot perform other transactions. A lobby deposit box or similar receptacle in which written payment orders or deposits may be placed is not an ATM. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(D.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> A facility may be an ATM within this definition even if it is a branch under state or federal law, although an ATM is not a branch as that term is used in this regulation. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(E.)">E. 229.2(d) Available for Withdrawal </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(E.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Under this definition, when funds become available for withdrawal, the funds may be put to all uses for which the customer may use actually and finally collected funds in the customer's account under the customer's account agreement with the bank. Examples of such uses include payment of checks drawn on the account, certification of checks, electronic payments, and cash withdrawals.

For purposes of this regulation, funds are considered available for withdrawal even though they are being held by the bank to satisfy an obligation of the customer other than the customer's potential liability for the return of the check. For example, a bank does not violate its obligations under this subpart by holding funds to satisfy a garnishment, tax levy, or court order restricting disbursements from the account; or to satisfy the customer's liability arising from the certification of a check, sale of a cashier's or teller's check, guaranty or acceptance of a check, or similar transaction to be debited from the customer's account. </p>

For purposes of Subparts C and D, and in connection therewith, Subpart A, any Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank, or any other person engaged in the business of banking is regarded as a bank. The phrase “any other person engaged in the business of banking” is derived from U.C.C. 1–201(4), and is intended to cover entities that handle checks for collection and payment, such as Edge and agreement corporations, commercial lending companies under <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/3101" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 3101</a>, certain industrial banks, and private bankers, so that virtually all checks will be covered by the same rules for forward collection and return, even though they may not be covered by the requirements of Subpart B.

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(G.)">G. 229.2(f) Banking Day and (g) Business Day </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(G.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act defines business day as any day excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. Legal holiday, however, is not defined, and the variety of local holidays, together with the practice of some banks to close midweek, makes the EFA Act's definition difficult to apply. The Board believes that two kinds of business days are relevant. First, when determining the day when funds are deposited or when a bank must perform certain actions (such as returning a check), the focus should be on a day that the bank is actually open for business. Second, when counting days for purposes of determining when funds must be available under the regulation or when notice of nonpayment must be received by the depositary bank, there would be confusion and uncertainty in trying to follow the schedule of a particular bank, and there is less need to identify a day when a particular bank is open. Most banks that act as intermediaries (large correspondents and Federal Reserve Banks) follow the same holiday schedule. Accordingly, the regulation has two definitions: Business day generally follows the standard Federal Reserve Bank holiday schedule (which is followed by most large banks), and banking day is defined to mean that part of a business day on which a bank is open for substantially all of its banking activities. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(G.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The definition of banking day corresponds to the definition of banking day in U.C.C. 4–104(a)(3), except that a banking day is defined in terms of a business day. Thus, if a bank is open on Saturday, Saturday might be a banking day for purposes of the U.C.C., but it would not be a banking day for purposes of Regulation CC because Saturday is never a business day under the regulation. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(G.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The definition of banking day is phrased in terms of when “an office of a bank is open” to indicate that a bank may observe a banking day on a per-branch basis. A deposit made at an ATM or off-premise facility (such as a remote depository or a lock box) is considered made at the branch holding the account into which the deposit is made for the purpose of determining the day of deposit. All other deposits are considered made at the branch at which the deposit is received. For example, under § 229.19(a)(1), funds deposited at an ATM are considered deposited at the time they are received at the ATM. On a calendar day that is a banking day for the branch or other location of the depositary bank at which the account is maintained, a deposit received at an ATM before the ATM's cut-off hour is considered deposited on that banking day, and a deposit received at an ATM after the ATM's cut-off hour is considered deposited on the next banking day of the branch or other location where the account is maintained. On a calendar day that is not a banking day for the account-holding location, all ATM deposits are considered deposited on that location's next banking day. This rule for determining the day of deposit also would apply to a deposit to an off-premise facility, such as a night depository or lock box, which is considered deposited when removed from the facility and available for processing under § 229.19(a)(3). If an unstaffed facility, such as a night depository or lock box, is on branch premises, the day of deposit is determined by the banking day at the branch at which the deposit is received, whether or not it is the branch at which the account is maintained. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(I.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The regulation adds to the second item in the EFA Act's definition of cashier's check the phrase, “on behalf of the bank as drawer,” to clarify that the term cashier's check is intended to cover only checks that a bank draws on itself. The definition of cashier's check includes checks provided to a customer of the bank in connection with customer deposit account activity, such as account disbursements and interest payments. The definition also includes checks acquired from a bank by noncustomers for remittance purposes, such as certain loan disbursement checks. Cashier's checks provided to customers or others are often labeled as “cashier's check,” “officer's check,” or “official check.” The definition excludes checks that a bank draws on itself for other purposes, such as to pay employees and vendors, and checks issued by the bank in connection with a payment service, such as a payroll or a bill-paying service. Cashier's checks generally are sold by banks to substitute the bank's credit for the customer's credit and thereby enhance the collectibility of the checks. A check issued in connection with a payment service generally is provided as a convenience to the customer rather than as a guarantee of the check's collectibility. In addition, such checks are often more difficult to distinguish from other types of checks than are cashier's checks as defined by this regulation. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(J.)">J. 229.2(j) Certified Check </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(J.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act defines a certified check as one to which a bank has certified that the drawer's signature is genuine and that the bank has set aside funds to pay the check. Under the Uniform Commercial Code, certification of a check means the bank's signed agreement that it will honor the check as presented (U.C.C. 3–409). The regulation defines certified check to include both the EFA Act's and U.C.C.'s definitions. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)">K. 229.2(k) Check </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Check is defined in section 602(7) of the EFA Act as a negotiable demand draft drawn on or payable through an office of a depository institution located in the United States, excluding noncash items. The regulation includes six categories of instruments within the definition of check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The first category is negotiable demand drafts drawn on, or payable through or at, an office of a bank. As the definition of bank includes only offices located in the United States, this category is limited to checks drawn on, or payable through or at, a banking office located in the United States. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act treats drafts payable through a bank as checks, even though under the U.C.C. the payable-through bank is a collecting bank to make presentment and generally is not authorized to make payment (U.C.C. 4–106(a)). The EFA Act does not expressly address items that are payable at a bank. This regulation treats both payable-through and payable-at demand drafts as checks. The Board believes that treating demand drafts payable at a bank as checks will not have a substantial effect on the operations of payable-at banks—by far the largest proportion of payable-at items are not negotiable demand drafts, but time items, such as commercial paper, bonds, notes, bankers' acceptances, and securities. These time items are not covered by the requirements of the EFA Act or this regulation. (The treatment of payable-through drafts is discussed in greater detail in connection with the definitions of local check and paying bank.) </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> The second category is checks drawn on Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. Principal and interest payments on federal debt instruments often are paid with checks drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank as fiscal agent of the United States, and these fiscal agency checks are indistinguishable from other checks drawn on Federal Reserve Banks. (See <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-31/part-355" class="cfr external">31 CFR Part 355</a>.) Federal Reserve Bank checks also are used by some banks as substitutes for cashier's or teller's checks. Similarly, savings and loan associations often use checks drawn on Federal Home Loan Banks as teller's checks. The definition of check includes checks drawn on Federal Home Loan Banks and Federal Reserve Banks because in many cases they are the functional equivalent of Treasury checks or teller's checks. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> The third and fourth categories of instrument included in the definition of check refer to government checks. The EFA Act refers to checks drawn on the U.S. Treasury, even though these instruments are not drawn on or payable through an office of a depository institution, and checks drawn by state and local governments. The EFA Act also gives the Board authority to define functionally equivalent instruments as depository checks.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-E-to-Part-229-footnote-1" id="Appendix-E-to-Part-229-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  Thus, the EFA Act is intended to apply to instruments other than those that meet the strict definition of check in section 602(7) of the EFA Act. Checks and warrants drawn by states and local governments often are used for the purposes of making unemployment compensation payments and other payments that are important to the recipients. Consequently, the Board has expressly defined check to include drafts drawn on the U.S. Treasury and drafts or warrants drawn by a state or a unit of general local government on itself. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)(6.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">6<span class="paren">.</span></span> The fifth category of instrument included in the definition of check is U.S. Postal Service money orders. These instruments are defined as checks because they often are used as a substitute for checks by consumers, even though money orders are not negotiable under Postal Service regulations. The Board has not provided specific rules for other types of money orders; these instruments generally are drawn on or payable through or payable at banks and are treated as checks on that basis. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(K.)(7.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">7<span class="paren">.</span></span> The sixth and final category of instrument included in the definition of check is traveler's checks drawn on or payable through or at a bank.

An account that does not meet the definition of consumer account is a nonconsumer account. A clearing account maintained at a bank directly by a brokerage firm is not a consumer account, even if the account is used to pay checks drawn by consumers using the funds in that account. The bank's relationship is with the brokerage firm, and the account is used by the brokerage firm to facilitate the clearing of its customers' checks. Because for purposes of Regulation CC the term account includes only deposit accounts, a consumer's revolving credit relationship or other line of credit with a bank is not a consumer account, even if the consumer draws on such credit lines by using a check. Both consumer and nonconsumer accounts are subject to the requirements of this regulation, including the requirement that funds be made available according to specific schedules and that the bank make specified disclosures of its availability policies. Section 229.18(b) (notices at branch locations) and § 229.18(e) (notice of changes in policy) apply only to consumer accounts.

A bank also is considered a depositary bank with respect to checks it receives as payee. For example, a bank is a depositary bank with respect to checks it receives for loan repayment, even though these checks are not deposited in an account at the bank.

A check payable by a local bank but payable through a nonlocal bank is a local check. Conversely, a check payable through a local bank but payable by a nonlocal bank is a nonlocal check. Where two banks are named on a check and neither is designated as a payable-through bank, the check is considered payable by either bank and may be considered local or nonlocal depending on the bank to which it is sent for payment. Generally, the depositary bank may rely on the routing number to determine whether a check is local or nonlocal. Appendix A includes a list of routing numbers arranged by Federal Reserve Bank Office to assist persons in determining whether or not such a check is local. If, however, a check is payable by one bank but payable through another bank, the routing number appearing on the check will be that of the payable-through bank, not the paying bank. Many credit union share drafts and certain other checks payable by banks are payable through other banks. In such cases, the routing number cannot be relied on to determine whether the check is local or nonlocal. For payable-through checks that meet the labeling requirements of § 229.36(e), the depositary bank may rely on the four-digit routing symbol of the paying bank that is printed on the face of the check as required by that section, e.g., in the title plate, but not on the first four digits of the payable-through bank's routing number printed in magnetic ink in the MICR line or in fractional form, to determine whether the check is local or nonlocal. </p>

To qualify as a noncash item, an item must be handled as such and may not be handled as a cash item by the depositary bank. </p>

For purposes of subparts C and D, the term paying bank also includes the payable-through bank and the bank whose routing number appears on the check, regardless of whether the check is payable by a different bank, provided that the check is sent for payment or collection to the payable through bank or the bank whose routing number appears on the check. </p>

The payable-through or payable-at bank may contract with the payor with respect to its liability in discharging these responsibilities. The Board believes that the EFA Act makes a clear connection between availability and the time it takes for checks to be cleared and returned. Allowing the payable-through bank additional time to forward checks to the payor and await return or pay instructions from the payor may delay the return of these checks, increasing the risks to depositary banks. <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-229/subpart-C" class="cfr external">Subpart C of this part</a> requires payable-through and payable-at banks to return a check expeditiously based on the time the payable-through or payable-at bank received the check for forward collection. </p>

Because the Federal Reserve Banks act as fiscal agents for the Treasury and the U.S. Postal Service and in that capacity are designated as presentment locations for Treasury checks and U.S. Postal Service money orders, a Treasury check or U.S. Postal Service money order presented to a Federal Reserve Bank is considered to be presented to the Treasury or U.S. Postal Service, respectively. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(AA.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> All deposits at nonproprietary ATMs are treated as deposits of nonlocal checks, and deposits at proprietary ATMs generally are treated as deposits at banking offices. The Conference Report on the EFA Act indicates that the special availability rules for deposits received through nonproprietary ATMs are provided because “nonproprietary ATMs today do not distinguish among check deposits or between check and cash deposits” (H.R. Rep. No. 261, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. at 179 (1987)). Thus, a deposit of any combination of cash and checks at a nonproprietary ATM may be treated as if it were a deposit of nonlocal checks, because the depositary bank does not know the makeup of the deposit and consequently is unable to place different holds on cash, local check, and nonlocal check deposits made at the ATM. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(AA.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> A colloquy between Senators Proxmire and Dodd during the floor debate on the Competitive Equality Banking Act (133 Cong. Rec. S11289 (Aug. 4, 1987)) indicates that whether a bank operates the ATM is the primary criterion in determining whether the ATM is proprietary to that bank. Because a bank should be capable of ascertaining the composition of deposits made to an ATM operated by that bank, an exception to the availability schedules is not warranted for these deposits. If more than one bank meets the “owns or operates” criterion, the ATM is considered proprietary to the bank that operates it. For the purpose of this definition, the bank that operates an ATM is the bank that puts checks deposited into the ATM into the forward collection stream. An ATM owned by one or more banks, but operated by a nonbank servicer, is considered proprietary to the bank or banks that own it. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(I.)(AA.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act also includes location as a factor in determining whether an ATM that is either owned or operated by a bank is proprietary to that bank. The definition of proprietary ATM includes an ATM located on the premises of the bank, either inside the branch or on its outside wall, regardless of whether the ATM is owned or operated by that bank. Because the EFA Act also defines a proprietary ATM as one that is “in close proximity” to the bank, the regulation defines an ATM located within 50 feet of a bank to be proprietary to that bank unless it is identified as being owned or operated by another entity. The Board believes that the statutory proximity test was designed to apply to situations where it would appear to the depositor that the ATM is run by his or her bank, because of the proximity of the ATM to the bank. The Board believes that an ATM located within 50 feet of a banking office would be presumed proprietary to that bank unless it is clearly identified as being owned or operated by another entity. </p>

The banks may meet this responsibility by returning a check to the depositary bank by the same general means used for forward collection of a check from the depositary bank to the paying bank. One way to speed the return process is to prepare the returned check for automated processing. Qualified returned checks are identified by placing a “2” in the case of an original check (or a “5” in the case of a substitute check) in position 44 of the qualified return MICR line as a return identifier in accordance with American National Standard Specifications for Placement and Location of MICR Printing, X9.13 (hereinafter “ANS X9.13”) for original checks or American National Standard Specifications for an Image Replacement Document—IRD, X9.100–140 (hereinafter “ANS X9.100–140”) for substitute checks. </p>

A returning bank is also a collecting bank for the purpose of a collecting bank's duty to exercise ordinary care under U.C.C. 4–202(b) and is analogous to a collecting bank for purposes of final settlement.

The routing number takes two forms—a fractional form and a nine-digit form. A paying bank is identified by both the fractional form routing number (which normally appears in the upper right hand corner of the check) and the nine-digit form. The nine-digit form of the routing number of the paying bank generally is printed in magnetic ink near the bottom of the check (the MICR line; see ANS X9.13). In the case of an electronic check, the routing number of the paying bank is contained in the electronic image of the check (in nine-digit form and fractional form) and in the electronic information related to the check (in nine-digit form). When a check is payable by one bank but payable through another bank, the routing number appearing on the check is that of the payable-through bank, not the payor bank. Industry standards require depositary banks, subsequent collecting banks, and returning banks to place their routing numbers in nine-digit form in their indorsements.

The definition in the regulation includes not only checks drawn by a bank on another bank, but also checks payable through or at a bank.

The definition does not include checks that are drawn by a nonbank on a nonbank even if payable through or at a bank. The definition includes checks provided to a customer of the bank in connection with customer deposit account activity, such as account disbursements and interest payments. The definition also includes checks acquired from a bank by a noncustomer for remittance purposes, such as certain loan disbursement checks. The definition excludes checks used by the bank to pay employees or vendors and checks issued by the bank in connection with a payment service, such as a payroll or a bill-paying service. Teller's checks generally are sold by banks to substitute the bank's credit for the customer's credit and thereby enhance the collectibility of the checks. A check issued in connection with a payment service generally is provided as a convenience to the customer rather than as a guarantee of the check's collectibility. In addition, such checks are often more difficult to distinguish from other types of checks than are teller's checks as defined by this regulation. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section, as well as other provisions of this subpart governing the availability of funds, provides that funds must be made available for withdrawal not later than a specified number of business days following the banking day on which the funds are deposited. Thus, a deposit is considered made only on a banking day, i.e., a day that the bank is open to the public for carrying on substantially all of its banking functions. For example, if a deposit is made at an ATM on a Saturday, Sunday, or other day on which the bank is closed to the public, the deposit is considered received on that bank's next banking day. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Nevertheless, business days are used to determine the number of days following the banking day of deposit that funds must be available for withdrawal. For example, if a deposit of a local check were made on a Monday, the availability schedule requires that funds be available for withdrawal on the second business day after deposit. Therefore, funds must be made available on Wednesday regardless of whether the bank was closed on Tuesday for other than a standard legal holiday as specified in the definition of business day. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(B.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph implements the EFA Act's requirement for next-day availability for cash deposits to accounts at a depositary bank “staffed by individuals employed by such institution.”<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-E-to-Part-229-footnote-2" id="Appendix-E-to-Part-229-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  Under this paragraph, cash deposited in an account at a staffed teller station on a Monday must become available for withdrawal by the start of business on Tuesday. It must become available for withdrawal by the start of business on Wednesday if it is deposited by mail, at a proprietary ATM, or by other means other than at a staffed teller station. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(C.)">C. 229.10(b) Electronic Payments </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act provides next-day availability for funds received for deposit by wire transfer. The regulation uses the term electronic payment, rather than wire transfer, to include both wire transfers and ACH credit transfers under the next-day availability requirement. (See discussion of definitions of automated clearinghouse, electronic payment, and wire transfer in § 229.2.) </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(C.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act requires that funds received by wire transfer be available for withdrawal not later than the business day following the day a wire transfer is received. This paragraph clarifies what constitutes receipt of an electronic payment. For the purposes of this paragraph, a bank receives an electronic payment when the bank receives both payment in finally collected funds and the payment instructions indicating the customer accounts to be credited and the amount to be credited to each account. For example, in the case of Fedwire, the bank receives finally collected funds at the time the payment is made. (See <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-210.31" class="cfr external">12 CFR 210.31</a>.) Finally collected funds generally are received for an ACH credit transfer when they are posted to the receiving bank's account on the settlement day. In certain cases, the bank receiving ACH credit payments will not receive the specific payment instructions indicating which accounts to credit until after settlement day. In these cases, the payments are not considered received until the information on the account and amount to be credited is received. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(C.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph also establishes the extent to which an electronic payment is considered made. Thus, if a participant on a private network fails to settle and the receiving bank receives finally settled funds representing only a partial amount of the payment, it must make only the amount that it actually received available for withdrawal. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(C.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> The availability requirements of this regulation do not preempt or invalidate other rules, regulations, or agreements which require funds to be made available on a more prompt basis. For example, the next-day availability requirement for ACH credits in this section does not preempt ACH association rules and Treasury regulations (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-31/part-210" class="cfr external">31 CFR part 210</a>), which provide that the proceeds of these credit payments be available to the recipient for withdrawal on the day the bank receives the funds. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)">D. 229.10(c) Certain Check Deposits </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act generally requires that funds be made available on the business day following the banking day of deposit for Treasury checks, state and local government checks, cashier's checks, certified checks, teller's checks, and “on us” checks, under specified conditions. (Treasury checks are checks drawn on the Treasury of the United States and have a routing number beginning with the digits “0000.”) This section also requires next-day availability for additional types of checks not addressed in the EFA Act. Checks drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank or a Federal Home Loan Bank and U.S. Postal Service money orders also must be made available on the first business day following the day of deposit under specified conditions. For the purposes of this section, all checks drawn on a Federal Reserve Bank or a Federal Home Loan Bank that contain in the MICR line a routing number that is listed in appendix A are subject to the next-day availability requirement if they are deposited in an account held by a payee of the check and in person to an employee of the depositary bank, regardless of the purposes for which the checks were issued. For all new accounts, even if the new account exception is not invoked, traveler's checks must be included in the $5,525 aggregation of checks deposited on any one banking day that are subject to the next-day availability requirement. (<em>See</em> § 229.13(a).) </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Deposit in Account of Payee. One statutory condition to receipt of next-day availability of Treasury checks, state and local government checks, cashier's checks, certified checks, and teller's checks is that the check must be “endorsed only by the person to whom it was issued.” The EFA Act could be interpreted to include a check that has been indorsed in blank and deposited into an account of a third party that is not named as payee. The Board believes that such a check presents greater risks than a check deposited by the payee and that Congress did not intend to require next-day availability for such checks. The regulation, therefore, provides that funds must be available on the business day following deposit only if the check is deposited in an account held by a payee of the check. For the purposes of this section, payee does not include transferees other than named payees. The regulation also applies this condition to Postal Service money orders and checks drawn on Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> Deposits Made to an Employee of the Depositary Bank. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(3.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> In most cases, next-day availability of the proceeds of checks subject to this section is conditioned on the deposit of these checks in person to an employee of the depositary bank. If the deposit is not made to an employee of the depositary bank on the premises of such bank, the proceeds of the deposit must be made available for withdrawal by the start of business on the second business day after deposit, under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20229#p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(c)(2)" class="cfr external">paragraph (c)(2)</a> of this section. For example, second-day availability rather than next-day availability would be allowed for deposits of checks subject to this section made at a proprietary ATM, night depository, through the mail or a lock box, or at a teller station staffed by a person who is not an employee of the depositary bank. Second-day availability also may be allowed for deposits picked up by an employee of the depositary bank at the customer's premises; such deposits would be considered made upon receipt at the branch or other location of the depositary bank. Employees of a contractual branch would not be considered employees of the depositary bank for the purposes of this regulation, and deposits at contractual branches would be treated the same as deposits to a proprietary ATM for the purposes of this regulation. (See also, Commentary to § 229.19(a).) </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(3.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> In the case of Treasury checks, the EFA Act and regulation do not condition the receipt of next-day availability to deposits at staffed teller stations. Therefore, Treasury checks deposited at a proprietary ATM must be accorded next-day availability, if the check is deposited to an account of a payee of the check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> <em class="paragraph-heading">“On Us”</em>  Checks. The EFA Act and regulation require next-day availability for “on us” checks, i.e., checks deposited in a branch of the depositary bank and drawn on the same or another branch of the same bank, if both branches are located in the same state or check processing region. Thus, checks deposited in one branch of a bank and drawn on another branch of the same bank must receive next-day availability even if the branch on which the checks are drawn is located in another check processing region but in the same state as the branch in which the check is deposited. For the purposes of this requirement, deposits at facilities that are not located on the premises of a brick-and-mortar branch of the bank, such as off-premise ATMs and remote depositories, are not considered deposits made at branches of the depositary bank. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> First $225 </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(5.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act and regulation also require that up to $225 of the aggregate deposit by check or checks not subject to next-day availability on any one banking day be made available on the next business day. For example, if $70 were deposited in an account by check(s) on a Monday, the entire $70 must be available for withdrawal at the start of business on Tuesday. If $400 were deposited by check(s) on a Monday, this section requires that $225 of the funds be available for withdrawal at the start of business on Tuesday. The portion of the customer's deposit to which the $225 must be applied is at the discretion of the depositary bank, as long as it is not applied to any checks subject to next-day availability. The $225 next-day availability rule does not apply to deposits at nonproprietary ATMs. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(5.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> The $225 that must be made available under this rule is in addition to the amount that must be made available for withdrawal on the business day after deposit under other provisions of this section. For example, if a customer deposits a $1,000 Treasury check and a $1,000 local check in its account on Monday, $1,225 must be made available for withdrawal on Tuesday—the proceeds of the $1,000 Treasury check, as well as the first $225 of the local check. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(5.)(c.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">c<span class="paren">.</span></span> A depositary bank may aggregate all local and nonlocal check deposits made by a customer on a given banking day for the purposes of the $225 next-day availability rule. Thus, if a customer has two accounts at the depositary bank, and on a particular banking day makes deposits to each account, $225 of the total deposited to the two accounts must be made available on the business day after deposit. Banks may aggregate deposits to individual and joint accounts for the purposes of this provision. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(5.)(d.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">d<span class="paren">.</span></span> If the customer deposits a $500 local check and gets $225 cash back at the time of deposit, the bank need not make an additional $225 available for withdrawal on the following day. Similarly, if the customer depositing the local check has a negative book balance, or negative available balance in its account at the time of deposit, the $225 that must be available on the next business day may be made available by applying the $225 to the negative balance, rather than making the $225 available for withdrawal by cash or check on the following day. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(6.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">6<span class="paren">.</span></span> Special Deposit Slips. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(6.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> Under the EFA Act, a depositary bank may require the use of a special deposit slip as a condition to providing next-day availability for certain types of checks. This condition was included in the EFA Act because many banks determine the availability of their customers' check deposits in an automated manner by reading the MICR-encoded routing number on the deposited checks. Using these procedures, a bank can determine whether a check is a local or nonlocal check, a check drawn on the Treasury, a Federal Reserve Bank, a Federal Home Loan Bank, or a branch of the depositary bank, or a U.S. Postal Service money order. Appendix A includes the routing numbers of certain categories of checks that are subject to next-day availability. The bank cannot require a special deposit slip for these checks. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(6.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank cannot distinguish whether the check is a state or local government check, cashier's check, certified check, or teller's check by reading the MICR-encoded routing number, because these checks bear the same routing number as other checks drawn on the same bank that are not accorded next-day availability. Therefore, a bank may require a special deposit slip for these checks. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(6.)(c.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">c<span class="paren">.</span></span> The regulation specifies that if a bank decides to require the use of a special deposit slip (or a special deposit envelope in the case of a deposit at an ATM or other unstaffed facility) as a condition to granting next-day availability under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20229#p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(c)(1)(iv)" class="cfr external">paragraphs (c)(1)(iv)</a> or <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20229#p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(c)(1)(v)" class="cfr external">(c)(1)(v)</a> of this section or second-day availability under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20229#p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(c)(2)" class="cfr external">paragraph (c)(2)</a> of this section, and if the deposit slip that must be used is different from the bank's regular deposit slips, the bank must either provide the special slips to its customers or inform its customers how such slips may be obtained and make the slips reasonably available to the customers. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(6.)(d.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">d<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank may meet this requirement by providing customers with an order form for the special deposit slips and allowing sufficient time for the customer to order and receive the slips before this condition is imposed. If a bank provides deposit slips in its branches for use by its customers, it also must provide the special deposit slips in the branches. If special deposit envelopes are required for deposits at an ATM, the bank must provide such envelopes at the ATM. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(IV.)(D.)(6.)(e.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">e<span class="paren">.</span></span> Generally, a teller is not required to advise depositors of the availability of special deposit slips merely because checks requiring special deposit slips for next-day availability are deposited without such slips. If a bank provides the special deposit slips only upon the request of a depositor, however, the teller must advise the depositor of the availability of the special deposit slips, or the bank must post a notice advising customers that the slips are available upon request. Such notice need not be posted at each teller window, but the notice must be posted in a place where consumers seeking to make deposits are likely to see it before making their deposits. For example, the notice might be posted at the point where the line forms for teller service in the lobby. The notice is not required at any drive-through teller windows nor is it required at night depository locations, or at locations where consumer deposits are not accepted. If a bank prepares a deposit for a depositor, it must use a special deposit slip where appropriate. A bank may require the customer to segregate the checks subject to next-day availability for which special deposit slips could be required, and to indicate on a regular deposit slip that such checks are being deposited, if the bank so instructs its customers in its initial disclosure. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act recognizes that the $450 that must be provided on the day specified in the schedule may exceed a bank's daily ATM cash withdrawal limit, and explicitly provides that the EFA Act does not supersede the bank's policy in this regard. The Board believes that the rationale for accommodating a bank's ATM withdrawal limit also applies to other cash withdrawal limits established by that bank. Section 229.19(c)(4) of the regulation addresses the relation between a bank's cash withdrawal limit (for over-the-counter cash withdrawals as well as ATM cash withdrawals) and the requirements of this subpart. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The Board believes that the Congress included this special cash withdrawal rule to provide a depositary bank with additional time to learn of the nonpayment of a check before it must make funds available to its customer. If a customer deposits a local check on a Monday, and that check is returned by the paying bank, the depositary bank may not receive the returned check until Thursday, the day after funds for a local check ordinarily must be made available for withdrawal. The intent of the special cash withdrawal rule is to minimize this risk to the depositary bank. For this rule to minimize the depositary bank's risk, it must apply not only to cash withdrawals, but also to withdrawals by other means that result in an irrevocable debit to the customer's account or commitment to pay by the bank on the customer's behalf during the day. Thus, the cash withdrawal rule also includes withdrawals by electronic payment, issuance of a cashier's or teller's check, certification of a check, or other irrevocable commitment to pay, such as authorization of an on-line point-of-sale debit. The rule also would apply to checks presented over the counter for payment on the day of presentment by the depositor or another person. Such checks could not be dishonored for insufficient funds if an amount sufficient to cover the check had became available for cash withdrawal under this rule; however, payment of such checks would be subject to the bank's cut-off hour established under U.C.C. 4–108. The cash withdrawal rule does not apply to checks and other provisional debits presented to the bank for payment that the bank has the right to return. </p>

Specifically, the EFA Act gives the Board the authority to establish exceptions to the schedules for large or redeposited checks and for accounts that have been repeatedly overdrawn. These exceptions apply to local and nonlocal checks as well as to checks that must otherwise be accorded next-day (or second-day) availability under § 229.10(c). </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Many checks will not be returned to the depositary bank by the time funds must be made available for withdrawal under the next-day (or second-day), local, and nonlocal schedules. In order to reduce risk to depositary banks, the Board has exercised its statutory authority to adopt these exceptions to the schedules in the regulation to allow the depositary bank to extend the time within which it is required to make funds available. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act also gives the Board the authority to suspend the schedules for any classification of checks, if the schedules result in an unacceptable level of fraud losses.

<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act provides an exception to the availability schedule for new accounts. An account is defined as a new account during the first 30 calendar days after the account is opened. An account is opened when the first deposit is made to the account. An account is not considered a new account, however, if each customer on the account has a transaction account relationship with the depositary bank, including a dormant account, that is at least 30 calendar days old or if each customer has had an established transaction account with the depositary bank within the 30 calendar days prior to opening the second account. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> The following are examples of what constitutes, and does not constitute, a new account: </p>

Similarly, if a customer closes an established account and opens a separate account within 30 days, the new account is not subject to the new account exception. </p>

<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(2.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> During the new account exception period, the schedules for local and nonlocal checks do not apply, and, unlike the other exceptions provided in this section, the regulation provides no maximum time frames within which the proceeds of these deposits must be made available for withdrawal. Maximum times within which funds must be available for withdrawal during the new account period are provided, however, for certain other deposits. Deposits received by cash and electronic payments must be made available for withdrawal in accordance with § 229.10. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(2.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> Special rules also apply to deposits of Treasury checks, U.S. Postal Service money orders, checks drawn on Federal Reserve Banks and Federal Home Loan Banks, state and local government checks, cashier's checks, certified checks, teller's checks, and, for the purposes of the new account exception only, traveler's checks. The first $5,000 of funds deposited to a new account on any one banking day by these check deposits must be made available for withdrawal in accordance with § 229.10(c). Thus, the first $5,525 of the proceeds of these check deposits must be made available on the first business day following deposit, if the deposit is made in person to an employee of the depositary bank and the other conditions of next-day availability are met. Funds must be made available on the second business day after deposit for deposits that are not made over the counter, in accordance with § 229.10(c)(2). (Proceeds of Treasury check deposits must be made available on the first business day after deposit, even if the check is not deposited in person to an employee of the depositary bank.) Funds in excess of the first $5,000 deposited by these types of checks on a banking day must be available for withdrawal not later than the ninth business day following the banking day of deposit. The requirements of § 229.10(c)(1)(vi) and (vii) that “on us” checks and the first $100 of a day's deposit be made available for withdrawal on the next business day do not apply during the new account period. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)">C. 229.13(b) Large Deposits </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Under the large deposit exception, a depositary bank may extend the hold placed on check deposits to the extent that the amount of the aggregate deposit on any banking day exceeds $5,525. This exception applies to local and nonlocal checks, as well as to checks that otherwise would be made available on the next (or second) business day after the day of deposit under § 229.10(c). Although the first $5,525 of a day's deposit is subject to the availability otherwise provided for checks, the amount in excess of $5,525 may be held for an additional period of time as provided in § 229.13(h). When the large deposit exception is applied to deposits composed of a mix of checks that would otherwise be subject to differing availability schedules, the depositary bank has the discretion to choose the portion of the deposit to which it applies the exception. Deposits by cash or electronic payment are not subject to this exception for large deposits. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The following example illustrates the operation of the large-deposit exception. If a customer deposits $2,000 in cash and a $9,000 local check on a Monday, $2,225 (the proceeds of the cash deposit and $225 from the local-check deposit) must be made available for withdrawal on Tuesday. An additional $5,300 of the proceeds of the local check must be available for withdrawal on Wednesday in accordance with the local schedule, and the remaining $3,475 may be held for an additional period of time under the large-deposit exception. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> Where a customer has multiple accounts with a depositary bank, the bank may apply the large deposit exception to the aggregate deposits to all of the customer's accounts, even if the customer is not the sole holder of the accounts and not all of the holders of the customer's accounts are the same. Thus, a depositary bank may aggregate the deposits made to two individual accounts in the same name, to an individual and a joint account with one common name, or to two joint accounts with at least one common name for the purpose of applying the large deposit exception. Aggregation of deposits to multiple accounts is permitted because the Board believes that the risk to the depositary bank associated with large deposits is similar regardless of how the deposits are allocated among the customer's accounts. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)">D. 229.13(c) Redeposited Checks </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act gives the Board the authority to promulgate an exception to the schedule for checks that have been returned unpaid and redeposited. Section 229.13(c) provides such an exception for checks that have been returned unpaid and redeposited by the customer or the depositary bank. This exception applies to local and nonlocal checks, as well as to checks that would otherwise be made available on the next (or second) business day after the day of deposit under § 229.10(c). </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> This exception addresses the increased risk to the depositary bank that checks that have been returned once will be uncollectible when they are presented to the paying bank a second time. The Board, however, does not believe that this increased risk is present for checks that have been returned due to a missing indorsement. Thus, the exception does not apply to checks returned unpaid due to missing indorsements and redeposited after the missing indorsement has been obtained, if the reason for return indicated on the check (see § 229.30(d)) states that it was returned due to a missing indorsement. For the same reason, this exception does not apply to a check returned because it was postdated (future dated), if the reason for return indicated on the check states that it was returned because it was postdated, and if it is no longer postdated when redeposited. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> To determine when funds must be made available for withdrawal, the banking day on which the check is redeposited is considered to be the day of deposit. A depositary bank that made $100 of a check available for withdrawal under § 229.10(c)(1)(vii) can charge back the full amount of the check, including the $100, if the check is returned unpaid, and the $100 need not be made available again if the check is redeposited. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)">E. 229.13(d) Repeated Overdrafts </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act gives the Board the authority to establish an exception for “deposit accounts which have been overdrawn repeatedly.” This paragraph provides two tests to determine what constitutes repeated overdrafts. Under the first test, a customer's accounts are considered repeatedly overdrawn if, on six banking days within the preceding six months, the available balance in any account held by the customer is negative, or the balance would have become negative if checks or other charges to the account had been paid, rather than returned. This test can be met based on separate occurrences (e.g., checks that are returned for insufficient funds on six different days), or based on one occurrence (e.g., a negative balance that remains on the customer's account for six banking days). If the bank dishonors a check that otherwise would have created a negative balance, however, the incident is considered an overdraft only on that day. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The second test addresses substantial overdrafts. Such overdrafts increase the risk to the depositary bank of dealing with the repeated overdrafter. Under this test, a customer incurs repeated overdrafts if, on two banking days within the preceding six months, the available balance in any account held by the customer is negative in an amount of $5,525 or more, or would have become negative in an amount of $5,525 or more if checks or other charges to the account had been paid. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The exception relates not only to overdrafts caused by checks drawn on the account, but also overdrafts caused by other debit charges (e.g. ACH debits, point-of-sale transactions, returned checks, account fees, etc.). If the potential debit is in excess of available funds, the exception applies regardless of whether the items were paid or returned unpaid. An overdraft resulting from an error on the part of the depositary bank, or from the imposition of overdraft charges for which the customer is entitled to a refund under §§ 229.13(e) or 229.16(c), cannot be considered in determining whether the customer is a repeated overdrafter. The exception excludes accounts with overdraft lines of credit, unless the credit line has been exceeded or would have been exceeded if the checks or other charges to the account had been paid. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> This exception applies to local and nonlocal checks, as well as to checks that otherwise would be made available on the next (or second) business day after the day of deposit under § 229.10(c).

This exception applies to local and nonlocal checks, as well as to checks that would otherwise be made available on the next (or second) business day after the day of deposit under § 229.10(c). When a bank places or extends a hold under this exception, it need not make the first $100 of a deposit available for withdrawal on the next business day, as otherwise would be required by § 229.10(c)(1)(vii). If the reasonable cause exception is invoked, the bank must include in the notice to its customer, required by § 229.13(g), the reason that the bank believes that the check is uncollectible. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(F.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The following are several examples of circumstances under which the reasonable cause exception may be invoked: </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(F.)(2.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> If a bank received a notice from the paying bank that a check was not paid and is being returned to the depositary bank, the depositary bank could place a hold on the check or extend a hold previously placed on that check, and notify the customer that the bank had received notice that the check is being returned. The exception could be invoked even if the notice were incomplete, if the bank had reasonable cause to believe that the notice applied to that particular check. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(F.)(2.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> The depositary bank may have received information from the paying bank, prior to the presentment of the check, that gives the bank reasonable cause to believe that the check is uncollectible. For example, the paying bank may have indicated that payment has been stopped on the check, or that the drawer's account does not currently have sufficient funds to honor the check. Such information may provide sufficient basis to invoke this exception. In these cases, the depositary bank could invoke the exception and disclose as the reason the exception is being invoked the fact that information from the paying bank indicates that the check may not be paid. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(F.)(2.)(c.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">c<span class="paren">.</span></span> The fact that a check is deposited more than six months after the date on the check (<em>i.e.</em> a stale check) is a reasonable indication that the check may be uncollectible, because under U.C.C. 4–404 a bank has no duty to its customer to pay a check that is more than six months old. Similarly, if a check being deposited is postdated (future dated), the bank may have a reasonable cause to believe the check is uncollectible, because the check may not be properly payable under U.C.C. 4–401. The bank, in its notice, should specify that the check is stale-dated or postdated. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(F.)(2.)(d.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">d<span class="paren">.</span></span> There are reasons that may cause a bank to believe that a check is uncollectible that are based on confidential information. For example, a bank could conclude that a check being deposited is uncollectible based on its reasonable belief that the depositor is engaging in kiting activity. Reasonable belief as to the insolvency or pending insolvency of the drawer of the check or the drawee bank and that the checks will not be paid also may justify invoking this exception. In these cases, the bank may indicate, as the reason it is invoking the exception, that the bank has confidential information that indicates that the check might not be paid. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(F.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The Board has included a reasonable cause exception notice as a model notice in appendix C (C–13). The model notice includes several reasons for which this exception may be invoked. The Board does not intend to provide a comprehensive list of reasons for which this exception may be invoked; another reason that does not appear on the model notice may be used as the basis for extending a hold, if the reason satisfies the conditions for invoking this exception. A depositary bank may invoke the reasonable cause exception based on a combination of factors that give rise to a reasonable cause to doubt the collectibility of a check. In these cases, the bank should disclose the primary reasons for which the exception was invoked in accordance with <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20229#p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(g)" class="cfr external">paragraph (g)</a> of this section. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(F.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> The regulation provides that the determination that a check is uncollectible shall not be based on a class of checks or persons. For example, a depositary bank cannot invoke this exception simply because the check is drawn on a paying bank in a rural area and the depositary bank knows it will not have the opportunity to learn of nonpayment of that check before funds must be made available under the availability schedules. Similarly, a depositary bank cannot invoke the reasonable cause exception based on the race or national origin of the depositor. </p>

A bank may assess an overdraft fee under these circumstances, however, if it provides notice to the customer, in the notice of exception required by <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20229#p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(g)" class="cfr external">paragraph (g)</a> of this section, that the fee may be subject to refund, and refunds the charges upon the request of the customer.

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(G.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Certain emergency conditions may arise that delay the collection or return of checks, or delay the processing and updating of customer accounts. In the circumstances specified in this paragraph, the depositary bank may extend the holds that are placed on deposits of checks that are affected by such delays, if the bank exercises such diligence as the circumstances require. For example, if a bank learns that a check has been delayed in the process of collection due to severe weather conditions or other causes beyond its control, an emergency condition covered by this section may exist and the bank may place a hold on the check to reflect the delay. This exception applies to local and nonlocal checks, as well as checks that would otherwise be made available on the next (or second) business day after the day of deposit under § 229.10(c). When a bank places or extends a hold under this exception, it need not make the first $100 of a deposit available for withdrawal on the next business day, as otherwise would be required by § 229.10(c)(1)(vii). In cases where the emergency conditions exception does not apply, as in the case of deposits of cash or electronic payments under § 229.10 (a) and (b), the depositary bank may not be liable for a delay in making funds available for withdrawal if the delay is due to a bona fide error such as an unavoidable computer malfunction. </p>

Information is in a form that the customer may keep if, for example, it can be downloaded or printed. For a customer who is a consumer, a depositary bank satisfies the written-notice requirement by sending an electronic notice in compliance with the requirements of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/7001" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 7001</a> <em>et seq.</em>), which include obtaining the consumer's affirmative consent to such means of notice. </p>

For example, for a deposit involving more than one check, the bank need not provide a notice that discloses when funds from each individual check in the deposit will be available for withdrawal; instead, the bank may provide a total dollar amount for each of the time periods when funds will be available, or provide the customer with an explanation of how to determine the amount of the deposit that will be held and when the funds will be available for deposit.

Notices provided under paragraph (g)(2) must contain the reason the exception may be invoked and the time period within which deposits subject to the exception will be available for withdrawal (see Model Notice C–14). A depositary bank may provide a one-time notice to a nonconsumer customer under paragraph (g)(2) only if each exception cited in the notice (the large deposit and/or the redeposited check exception) will be invoked for most check deposits to the customer's account to which the exception could apply. A one-time notice may state that the depositary bank will apply exception holds to certain subsets of deposits to which the large deposit or redeposited check exception may apply, and the notice should identify such subsets. For example, the depositary bank may apply the redeposited check exception only to checks that were redeposited automatically by the depositary bank in accordance with an agreement with the customer, rather than to all redeposited checks. In lieu of sending the one-time notice, a depositary bank may send individual hold notices for each deposit subject to the large deposit or redeposited check exception in accordance with § 229.13(g)(1) (see Model Notice C–12). </p>

Under these circumstances, it likely would be reasonable for the depositary bank to provide an emergency conditions exception notice in the same manner and within the same time as required for other exception notices. On the other hand, if a depositary bank experiences a weather or power outage emergency that affects its own operations, it may be reasonable for the depositary bank to provide a general notice to all depositors via postings at branches and ATMs, or through newspaper, television, or radio notices. </p>

In many cases, such as where the exception was invoked on the basis of a notice of nonpayment received, the record requirement may be met by retaining a copy of the notice sent to the customer. In other cases, such as where the exception was invoked on the basis of confidential information, a further description to the facts, such as insolvency of drawer, should be included in the record. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)">A. 229.14(a) In General </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section requires that a depositary bank begin accruing interest on interest-bearing accounts not later than the day on which the depositary bank receives credit for the funds deposited.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-E-to-Part-229-footnote-3" id="Appendix-E-to-Part-229-footref-3">3</a>] </sup>  A depositary bank generally receives credit on checks within one or two days following deposit. A bank receives credit on a cash deposit, an electronic payment, and the deposit of a check that is drawn on the depositary bank itself on the day the cash, electronic payment, or check is received. In the case of a deposit at a nonproprietary ATM, credit generally is received on the day the bank that operates the ATM credits the depositary bank for the amount of the deposit. In the case of a deposit at a contractual branch, credit is received on the day the depositary bank receives credit for the amount of the deposit, which may be different from the day the contractual branch receives credit for the deposit. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Because account includes only transaction accounts, other interest-bearing accounts of the depositary bank, such as money market deposit accounts, savings deposits, and time deposits, are not subject to this requirement; however, a bank may accrue interest on such deposits in the same way that it accrues interest under this paragraph for simplicity of operation. The Board intends the term interest to refer to payments to or for the account of any customer as compensation for the use of funds, but to exclude the absorption of expenses incident to providing a normal banking function or a bank's forbearance from charging a fee in connection with such a service. (See <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-217.2#p-217.2(d)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 217.2(d)</a>.) Thus, earnings credits often applied to corporate accounts are not interest payments for the purposes of this section. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> It may be difficult for a depositary bank to track which day the depositary bank receives credit for specific checks in order to accrue interest properly on the account to which the check is deposited. This difficulty may be pronounced if the bank uses different means of collecting checks based on the time of day the check is received, the dollar amount of the check, and/or the paying bank to which it must be sent. Thus, for the purpose of the interest accrual requirement, a bank may rely on an availability schedule from its Federal Reserve Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank, or correspondent to determine when the depositary bank receives credit. If availability is delayed beyond that specified in the availability schedule, a bank may charge back interest erroneously accrued or paid on the basis of that schedule. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph also permits a depositary bank to accrue interest on checks deposited to all of its interest-bearing accounts based on when the bank receives credit on all checks sent for payment or collection. For example, if a bank receives credit on 20 percent of the funds deposited in the bank by check as of the business day of deposit (e.g., “on us” checks), 70 percent as of the business day following deposit, and 10 percent on the second business day following deposit, the bank can apply these percentages to determine the day interest must begin to accrue on check deposits to all interest-bearing accounts, regardless of when the bank received credit on the funds deposited in any particular account. Thus, a bank may begin accruing interest on a uniform basis for all interest-bearing accounts, without the need to track the type of check deposited to each account. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section is not intended to limit a policy of a depositary bank that provides that interest accrues only on balances that exceed a specified amount, or on the minimum balance maintained in the account during a given period, provided that the balance is determined based on the date that the depositary bank receives credit for the funds. This section also is not intended to limit any policy providing that interest accrues sooner than required by this paragraph. </p>

These credit unions are exempt from the payment-of-interest requirements, as long as they provide notice of their interest accrual policies in accordance with § 229.16(d). For example, if a credit union has a policy of computing interest on all deposits received by the 10th of the month from the first of that month, and on all deposits received after the 10th of the month from the first of the next month, that policy is not superseded by this regulation, if the credit union provides proper disclosure of this policy to its customers. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph sets forth the general requirements for the disclosures required under Subpart B. All of the disclosures must be given in a clear and conspicuous manner, must be in writing, and, in most cases, must be in a form the customer may keep. A disclosure is in a form that the customer may keep if, for example, it can be downloaded or printed. For a customer that is not a consumer, a depositary bank satisfies the written-disclosure requirement by sending an electronic disclosure that displays the text and is in a form that the customer may keep, if the customer agrees to such means of disclosure. For a customer who is a consumer, a depositary bank satisfies the written-notice requirement by sending an electronic notice in compliance with the requirements of the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/7001" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 7001</a> <em>et seq.</em>), which include obtaining the consumer's affirmative consent to such means of notice. Disclosures posted at locations where employees accept consumer deposits, at ATMs, and on preprinted deposit slips need not be in a form that the customer may keep. Appendix C of the regulation contains model forms, clauses, and notices to assist banks in preparing disclosures. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Disclosures concerning availability must be grouped together and may not contain any information that is not related to the disclosures required by this subpart. Therefore, banks may not intersperse the required disclosures with other account disclosures, and may not include other account information that is not related to their availability policy within the text of the required disclosures. Banks may, however, include information that is related to their availability policies. For example, a bank may inform its customers that, even when the bank has already made funds available for withdrawal, the customer is responsible for any problem with the deposit, such as the return of a deposited check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The regulation does not require that the disclosures be segregated from other account terms and conditions. For example, banks may include the disclosure of their specific availability policy in a booklet or pamphlet that sets out all of the terms and conditions of the bank's accounts. The required disclosures must, however, be grouped together and highlighted or identified in some manner, for example, by use of a separate heading for the disclosures, such as “When Deposits are Available for Withdrawal.” </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank may, by agreement or at the consumer's request, provide any disclosure or notice required by subpart B in a language other than English, provided that the bank makes a complete disclosure available in English at the customer's request. </p>

Banks must disclose when deposited funds are available for withdrawal by stating the business day on which the customer may begin to withdraw funds. The business day funds will be available must be disclosed as “the ________________ business day after” the day of deposit, or substantially similar language. The business day of availability is determined by counting the number of business days starting with the business day following the banking day on which the deposit is received, as determined under § 229.19(a), and ending with the business day on which the customer may begin to withdraw funds. For example, a bank that imposes delays of four intervening business days for nonlocal checks must describe those checks as being available on “the fifth business day after” the day of the deposit. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph makes clear that banks need not provide disclosure of their specific availability policies to customers that hold accounts that are either dormant or inactive. The determination that certain accounts are dormant or inactive must be made by the bank. If a bank considers an account dormant or inactive for purposes other than this regulation and no longer provides statements and other mailings to an account for this reason, such an account is considered dormant or inactive for purposes of this regulation. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">X. Section 229.16 Specific Availability Policy Disclosure </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)">A. 229.16(a) General </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section describes the information that must be disclosed by banks to comply with §§ 229.17 and 229.18(d), which require that banks furnish notices of their specific policy regarding availability of deposited funds. The disclosure provided by a bank must reflect the availability policy followed by the bank in most cases, even though a bank may in some cases make funds available sooner or impose a longer delay. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The disclosure must reflect the policy and practice of the bank regarding availability as to most accounts and most deposits into those accounts. In disclosing the availability policy that it follows in most cases, a bank may provide a single disclosure that reflects one policy to all its transaction account customers, even though some of its customers may receive faster availability than that reflected in the policy disclosure. Thus, a bank need not disclose to some customers that they receive faster availability than indicated in the disclosure. If, however, a bank has a policy of imposing delays in availability on any customers longer than those specified in its disclosure, those customers must receive disclosures that reflect the longer applicable availability periods. A bank may establish different availability policies for different groups of customers, such as customers in a particular geographic area or customers of a particular branch. For purposes of providing a specific availability policy, the bank may allocate customers among groups through good faith use of a reasonable method. A bank may also establish different availability policies for deposits at different locations, such as deposits at a contractual branch. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank may disclose that funds are available for withdrawal on a given day notwithstanding the fact that the bank uses the funds to pay checks received before that day. For example, a bank may disclose that its policy is to make funds available from deposits of local checks on the second business day following the day of deposit, even though it may use the deposited funds to pay checks prior to the second business day; the funds used to pay checks in this example are not available for withdrawal until the second business day after deposit because the funds are not available for all uses until the second business day. (See the definition of available for withdrawal in § 229.2(d).) </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)">B. 229.16(b) Content of Specific Policy Disclosure </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph sets forth the items that must be included, as applicable, in a bank's specific availability policy disclosure. The information that must be disclosed by a particular bank will vary considerably depending upon the bank's availability policy. For example, a bank that makes deposited funds available for withdrawal on the business day following the day of deposit need simply disclose that deposited funds will be available for withdrawal on the first business day after the day of deposit, the bank's business days, and when deposits are considered received. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> On the other hand, a bank that has a policy of routinely delaying on a blanket basis the time when deposited funds are available for withdrawal would have a more detailed disclosure. Such blanket hold policies might be for the maximum time allowed under the federal law or might be for shorter periods. These banks must disclose the types of deposits that will be subject to delays, how the customer can determine the type of deposit being made, and the day that funds from each type of deposit will be available for withdrawal. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> Some banks may have a combination of next-day availability and blanket delays. For example, a bank may provide next-day availability for all deposits except for one or two categories, such as deposits at nonproprietary ATMs and nonlocal personal checks over a specified dollar amount. The bank would describe the categories that are subject to delays in availability and tell the customer when each category would be available for withdrawal, and state that other deposits will be available for withdrawal on the first business day after the day of deposit. Similarly, a bank that provides availability on the second business day for most of its deposits would need to identify the categories of deposits which, under the regulation, are subject to next-day availability and state that all other deposits will be available on the second business day. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> Because many banks' availability policies may be complex, a bank must give a brief summary of its policy at the beginning of the disclosure. In addition, the bank must describe any circumstances when actual availability may be longer than the schedules disclosed. Such circumstances would arise, for example, when the bank invokes one of the exceptions set forth in § 229.13 of the regulation, or when the bank delays or extends the time when deposited funds are available for withdrawal up to the time periods allowed by the regulation on a case-by-case basis. Also, a bank that must make certain checks available faster under appendix B (reduction of schedules for certain nonlocal checks) must state that some check deposits will be available for withdrawal sooner because of special rules and that a list of the pertinent routing numbers is available upon request. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> Generally, a bank that distinguishes in its disclosure between local and nonlocal checks based on the routing number on the check must disclose to its customers that certain checks, such as some credit union payable-through drafts, will be treated as local or nonlocal based on the location of the bank by which they are payable (e.g., the credit union), and not on the basis of the location of the bank whose routing number appears on the check. A bank is not required to provide this disclosure, however, if it makes the proceeds of both local and nonlocal checks available for withdrawal within the time periods required for local checks in §§ 229.12 and 229.13. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(6.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">6<span class="paren">.</span></span> The business day cut-off time used by the bank must be disclosed and if some locations have different cut-off times the bank must note this in the disclosure and state the earliest time that might apply. A bank need not list all of the different cut-off times that might apply. If a bank does not have a cut-off time prior to its closing time, the bank need not disclose a cut-off time. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(7.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">7<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank taking advantage of the extended time period for making deposits at nonproprietary ATMs available for withdrawal under § 229.12(f) must explain this in the initial disclosure. In addition, the bank must provide a list (on or with the initial disclosure) of either the bank's proprietary ATMs or those ATMs that are nonproprietary at which customers may make deposits. As an alternative to providing such a list, the bank may label all of its proprietary ATMs with the bank's name and state in the initial disclosure that this has been done. Similarly, a bank taking advantage of the cash withdrawal limitations of § 229.12(d), or the provision in § 229.19(e) allowing holds to be placed on other deposits when a deposit is made or a check is cashed, must explain this in the initial disclosure. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(8.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">8<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank that provides availability based on when the bank generally receives credit for deposited checks need not disclose the time when a check drawn on a specific bank will be available for withdrawal. Instead, the bank may disclose the categories of deposits that must be available on the first business day after the day of deposit (deposits subject to § 229.10) and state the other categories of deposits and the time periods that will be applicable to those deposits. For example, a bank might disclose the four-digit Federal Reserve routing symbol for local checks and indicate that such checks as well as certain nonlocal checks will be available for withdrawal on the first or second business day following the day of deposit, depending on the location of the particular bank on which the check is drawn, and disclose that funds from all other checks will be available on the second or third business day. The bank must also disclose that the customer may request a copy of the bank's detailed schedule that would enable the customer to determine the availability of any check and must provide such schedule upon request. A change in the bank's detailed schedule would not trigger the change in policy disclosure requirement of § 229.18(e). </p>

<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> In addition to stating what their specific availability policy is in most cases, banks that may delay or extend the time when deposits are available on a case-by-case basis must: state that from time to time funds may be available for withdrawal later than the time periods in their specific policy disclosure, disclose the latest time that a customer may have to wait for deposited funds to be available for withdrawal when a case-by-case hold is placed, state that customers will be notified when availability of a deposit is delayed on a case-by-case basis, and advise customers to ask if they need to be sure of the availability of a particular deposit. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)(c.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">c<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank that imposes delays on a case-by-case basis is still subject to the availability requirements of this regulation. If the bank imposes a delay on a particular deposit that is not longer than the availability required by § 229.12 for local and nonlocal checks, the reason for the delay need not be based on the exceptions provided in § 229.13. If the delay exceeds the time periods permitted under § 229.12, however, then it must be based on an exception provided in § 229.13, and the bank must comply with the § 229.13 notice requirements. A bank that imposes delays on a case-by-case basis may avail itself of the one-time notice provisions in § 229.13(g)(2) and (3) for deposits to which those provisions apply. </p>

The notice must state that a delay is being imposed and indicate when the funds will be available. In addition, the notice must include the account number, the date of the deposit, and the amount of the deposit being delayed. </p>

The notice must state that the customer may be entitled to a refund of any overdraft or returned check fees that result from the deposited funds not being available if the check that was deposited was in fact paid by the payor bank, and explain how to request a refund of any fees.

This requirement is satisfied if the notice provides information sufficient to indicate when funds will be available and the amounts that will be available at those times. For example, for a deposit involving more than one check, the bank need not provide a notice that discloses when funds from each individual item in the deposit will be available for withdrawal. Instead, the bank may provide a total dollar amount for each of the time periods when funds will be available, or provide the customer with an explanation of how to determine the amount of the deposit that will be held and when the held funds will be available for withdrawal. </p>

For other deposits, such as deposits received at an ATM, lobby deposit box, night depository, through the mail, or by armored car, notice must be mailed to the customer not later than the close of the business day following the banking day on which the deposit was made. Notice to the customer also may be provided not later than the close of the business day following the banking day on which the deposit was made if the decision to delay availability is made after the time of the deposit. </p>

A bank may assess an overdraft or returned check fee under these circumstances, however, if it provides notice to the customer in the notice required by <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/appendix-Appendix%20E%20to%20Part%20229#p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(c)(2)" class="cfr external">paragraph (c)(2)</a> of this section that the fee may be subject to refund, and refunds the fee upon the request of the customer when required to do so.

The requirement of a notice prior to opening an account requires banks to provide disclosures prior to accepting a deposit to open an account.

If a bank, however, receives a written request by mail from a person asking that an account be opened and the request includes an initial deposit, the bank may open the account with the deposit, provided the bank mails the required disclosures to the customer not later than the business day following the banking day on which the bank receives the deposit. Similarly, if a bank receives a telephone request from a customer asking that an account be opened with a transfer from a separate account of the customer's at the bank, the disclosure may be mailed not later than the business day following the banking day of the request. </p>

For example, the notice might be posted at the point where the line forms for teller service in the lobby. The notice is not required at any drive-through teller windows nor is it required at night depository locations, or at locations where consumer deposits are not accepted. A bank that acts as a contractual branch at a particular location must include the availability policy that applies to its own customers but need not include the policy that applies to the customers of the bank for which it is acting as a contractual branch. </p>

A night depository is a receptacle for receipt of deposits, typically used by corporate depositors when the branch is closed. Funds deposited at a night depository are considered deposited on the banking day the deposit is removed, and the contents of the deposit are accessible to the depositary bank for processing. For example, some businesses deposit their funds in a locked bag at the night depository late in the evening, and return to the bank the following day to open the bag. Other depositors may have an agreement with their bank that the deposit bag must be opened under the dual control of the bank and the depositor.

<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(6.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph also provides that a deposit received on a day that the depositary bank is closed, or after the bank's cut-off hour, may be considered made on the next banking day. Generally, for purposes of the availability schedules of this subpart, a bank may establish a cut-off hour of 2 p.m. or later for receipt of deposits at its head office or branch offices. For receipt of deposits at ATMs, contractual branches, or other off-premise facilities, such as night depositories or lock boxes, the depositary bank may establish a cut-off hour of 12:00 noon or later (either local time of the branch or other location of the depositary bank at which the account is maintained or local time of the ATM, contractual branch, or other off-premise facility). The depositary bank must use the same timing method for establishing the cut-off hour for all ATMs, contractual branches, and other off-premise facilities used by its customers. The choice of cut-off hour must be reflected in the bank's internal procedures, and the bank must inform its customers of the cut-off hour upon request. This earlier cut-off for ATM, contractual branch, or other off-premise deposits is intended to provide greater flexibility in the servicing of these facilities. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(6.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> Different cut-off hours may be established for different types of deposits. For example, a bank may establish a 2 p.m. cut-off for the receipt of check deposits, but a later cut-off for the receipt of wire transfers. Different cut-off hours also may be established for deposits received at different locations. For example, a different cut-off may be established for ATM deposits than for over-the-counter deposits, or for different teller stations at the same branch. With the exception of the 12 noon cut-off for deposits at ATMs and off-premise facilities, no cut-off hour for receipt of deposits for purposes of this subpart can be established earlier than 2 p.m. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(6.)(c.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">c<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank is not required to remain open until 2 p.m. If a bank closes before 2 p.m., deposits received after the closing may be considered deposited on the next banking day. Further, as § 229.2(f) defines the term banking day as the portion of a business day on which a bank is open to the public for substantially all of its banking functions, a day, or a portion of a day, is not necessarily a banking day merely because the bank is open for only limited functions, such as keeping drive-in or walk-up teller windows open, when the rest of the bank is closed to the public. For example, a banking office that usually provides a full range of banking services may close at 12 noon but leave a drive-in teller window open for the limited purpose of receiving deposits and making cash withdrawals. Under those circumstances, the bank is considered closed and may consider deposits received after 12 noon as having been received on the next banking day. The fact that a bank may reopen for substantially all of its banking functions after 2 p.m., or that it continues its back office operations throughout the day, would not affect this result. A bank may not, however, close individual teller stations and reopen them for next-day's business before 2 p.m. during a banking day. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)">B. 229.19(b) Availability at Start of Business Day </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> If funds must be made available for withdrawal on a business day, the funds must be available for withdrawal by the later of 9 a.m. or the time the depositary bank's teller facilities, including ATMs, are available for customer account withdrawals, except under the special rule for cash withdrawals set forth in § 229.12(d). Thus, if a bank has no ATMs and its branch facilities are available for customer transactions beginning at 10 a.m., funds must be available for customer withdrawal beginning at 10 a.m. If the bank has ATMs that are available 24 hours a day, rather than establishing 12:01 a.m. as the start of the business day, this paragraph sets 9 a.m. as the start of the day with respect to ATM withdrawals. The Board believes that this rule provides banks with sufficient time to update their accounting systems to reflect the available funds in customer accounts for that day. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The start of business is determined by the local time of the branch or other location of the depositary bank at which the account is maintained. For example, if funds in a customer's account at a west coast bank are first made available for withdrawal at the start of business on a given day, and the customer attempts to withdraw the funds at an east coast ATM, the depositary bank is not required to make the funds available until 9 a.m. west coast time (12 noon east coast time). </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)">C. 229.19(c) Effect on Policies of Depositary Bank </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This subpart establishes the maximum hold that may be placed on customer deposits. A depositary bank may provide availability to its customers in a shorter time than prescribed in this subpart. A depositary bank also may adopt different funds availability policies for different segments of its customer base, as long as each policy meets the schedules in the regulation. For example, a bank may differentiate between its corporate and consumer customers, or may adopt different policies for its consumer customers based on whether a customer has an overdraft line of credit associated with the account. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> This regulation does not affect a depositary bank's right to accept or reject a check for deposit, to charge back the customer's account based on a returned check or notice of nonpayment, or to claim a refund for any credit provided to the customer. For example, even if a check is returned or a notice of nonpayment is received after the time by which funds must be made available for withdrawal in accordance with this regulation, the depositary bank may charge back the customer's account for the full amount of the check. (See § 229.33(d) and Commentary.) </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> Nothing in the regulation requires a depositary bank to have facilities open for customers to make withdrawals at specified times or on specified days. For example, even though the special cash withdrawal rule set forth in § 229.12(d) states that a bank must make up to $400 available for cash withdrawals no later than 5 p.m. on specific business days, if a bank does not participate in an ATM system and does not have any teller windows open at or after 5 p.m., the bank need not join an ATM system or keep offices open. In this case, the bank complies with this rule if the funds that are required to be available for cash withdrawal at 5 p.m. on a particular day are available for withdrawal at the start of business on the following day. Similarly, if a depositary bank is closed for customer transactions, including ATMs, on a day funds must be made available for withdrawal, the regulation does not require the bank to open. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> The special cash withdrawal rule in the EFA Act recognizes that the $400 that must be made available for cash withdrawal by 5 p.m. on the day specified in the schedule may exceed a bank's daily ATM cash withdrawal limit and explicitly provides that the EFA Act does not supersede a bank's policy in this regard. As a result, if a bank has a policy of limiting cash withdrawals from automated teller machines to $250 per day, the regulation would not require that the bank dispense $400 of the proceeds of the customer's deposit that must be made available for cash withdrawal on that day. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> Even though the EFA Act clearly provides that the bank's ATM withdrawal limit is not superseded by the federal availability rules on the day funds must first be made available, the EFA Act does not specifically permit banks to limit cash withdrawals at ATMs on subsequent days when the entire amount of the deposit must be made available for withdrawal. The Board believes that the rationale behind the EFA Act's provision that a bank's ATM withdrawal limit is not superseded by the requirement that funds be made available for cash withdrawal applies on subsequent days. Nothing in the regulation prohibits a depositary bank from establishing ATM cash withdrawal limits that vary among customers of the bank, as long as the limit is not dependent on the length of time funds have been in the customer's account (provided that the permissible hold has expired). </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(6.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">6<span class="paren">.</span></span> Some small banks, particularly credit unions, due to lack of secure facilities, keep no cash on their premises and hence offer no cash withdrawal capability to their customers. Other banks limit the amount of cash on their premises due to bonding requirements or cost factors, and consequently reserve the right to limit the amount of cash each customer can withdraw over-the-counter on a given day. For example, some banks require advance notice for large cash withdrawals in order to limit the amount of cash needed to be maintained on hand at any time. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(7.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">7<span class="paren">.</span></span> Nothing in the regulation is intended to prohibit a bank from limiting the amount of cash that may be withdrawn at a staffed teller station if the bank has a policy limiting the amount of cash that may be withdrawn, and if that policy is applied equally to all customers of the bank, is based on security, operating, or bonding requirements, and is not dependent on the length of time the funds have been in the customer's account (as long as the permissible hold has expired). The regulation, however, does not authorize such policies if they are otherwise prohibited by statutory, regulatory, or common law. </p>

Under calculated availability, a specified percentage of funds from check deposits may be made available to the customer on the next business day, with the remaining percentage deferred until subsequent days. The determination of the percentage of deposited funds that will be made available each day is based on the customer's typical deposit mix as determined by a sample of the customer's deposits. Use of calculated availability is permitted only if, on average, the availability terms that result from the sample are equivalent to or more prompt than the requirements of this subpart. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph clarifies that if a customer deposits a check in an account (as defined in § 229.2(a)), the bank may not place a hold on any of the customer's funds so that the funds that are held exceed the amount of the check deposited or the total amount of funds held are not made available for withdrawal within the times required in this subpart. For example, if a bank places a hold on funds in a customer's non transaction account, rather than a transaction account, for deposits made to the customer's transaction account, the bank may place such a hold only to the extent that the funds held do not exceed the amount of the deposit and the length of the hold does not exceed the time periods permitted by this regulation. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> These restrictions also apply to holds placed on funds in a customer's account (as defined in § 229.2(a)) if a customer cashes a check at a bank (other than a check drawn on that bank) over the counter. The regulation does not prohibit holds that may be placed on other funds of the customer for checks cashed over the counter, to the extent that the transaction does not involve a deposit to an account. A bank may not, however, place a hold on any account when an “on us” check is cashed over the counter. “On us” checks are considered finally paid when cashed (see U.C.C. 4–215(a)(1)). When a customer cashes a check over the counter and the bank places a hold on an account of the customer, the bank must give whatever notice would have been required under §§ 229.13 or 229.16 had the check been deposited in the account. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)">A. 229.20(a) In General </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Several states have enacted laws that govern when banks in those states must make funds available to their customers. The EFA Act provides that any state law in effect on September 1, 1989, that provides that funds be made available in a shorter period of time than provided in this regulation, will supersede the time periods in the EFA Act and the regulation. The Conference Report on the EFA Act clarifies this provision by stating that any state law enacted on or before September 1, 1989, may supersede federal law to the extent that the law relates to the time funds must be made available for withdrawal. H.R. Rep. No. 261, 100th Cong. 1st Sess. at 182 (1987). </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Thus, if a state had wished to adopt a law governing funds availability, it had to have made that law effective on or before September 1, 1989. Laws adopted after that date do not supersede federal law, even if they provide for shorter availability periods than are provided under federal law. If a state that had a law governing funds availability in effect before September 1, 1989, amended its law after that date, the amendment would not supersede federal law, but an amendment deleting a state requirement would be effective. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> If a state provides for a shorter hold for a certain category of checks than is provided for under federal law, that state requirement will supersede the federal provision. For example, most state laws base some hold periods on whether the check being deposited is drawn on an in-state or out-of-state bank. If a state contains more than one check processing region, the state's hold period for in-state checks may be shorter than the federal maximum hold period for nonlocal checks. Thus, the state schedule would supersede the federal schedule to the extent that it applies to in-state, nonlocal checks. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> The EFA Act also provides that any state law that provides for availability in a shorter period of time than required by federal law is applicable to all federally insured institutions in that state, including federally chartered institutions. If a state law provides shorter availability only for deposits in accounts in certain categories of banks, such as commercial banks, the superseding state law continues to apply only to those categories of banks, rather than to all federally insured banks in the state. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)">B. 229.20(b) Preemption of Inconsistent Law </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph reflects the statutory provision that other provisions of state law that are inconsistent with federal law are preempted. Preemption does not require a determination by the Board to be effective. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)">C. 229.20(c) Standards for Preemption </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section describes the standards the Board uses in making determinations on whether federal law will preempt state laws governing funds availability. A provision of state law is considered inconsistent with federal law if it permits a depositary bank to make funds available to a customer in a longer period of time than the maximum period permitted by the EFA Act and this regulation. For example, a state law that permits a hold of four business days or longer for local checks permits a hold that is longer than that permitted under the EFA Act and this regulation, and therefore is inconsistent and preempted. State availability schedules that provide for availability in a shorter period of time than required under Regulation CC supersede the federal schedule. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Under a state law, some categories of deposits could be available for withdrawal sooner or later than the time required by this subpart, depending on the composition of the deposit. For example, the EFA Act and this regulation (§ 229.10(c)(1)(vii)) require next-day availability for the first $225 of the aggregate deposit of local or nonlocal checks on any day, and a state law could require next-day availability for any check of $200 or less that is deposited. Under the EFA Act and this regulation, if either one $300 check or three $100 checks are deposited on a given day, $225 must be made available for withdrawal on the next business day, and $75 must be made available in accordance with the local or nonlocal schedule. Under the state law, however, the two deposits would be subject to different availability rules. In the first case, none of the proceeds of the deposit would be subject to next-day availability; in the second case, the entire proceeds of the deposit would be subject to next-day availability. In this example, because the state law would, in some situations, permit a hold longer than the maximum permitted by the EFA Act, this provision of state law is inconsistent and preempted in its entirety. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> In addition to the differences between state and federal availability schedules, a number of state laws contain exceptions to the state availability schedules that are different from those provided under the EFA Act and this regulation. The state exceptions continue to apply only in those cases where the state schedule is shorter than or equal to the federal schedule, and then only up to the limit permitted by the Regulation CC schedule. Where a deposit is subject to a state exception under a state schedule that is not preempted by Regulation CC and is also subject to a federal exception, the hold on the deposit cannot exceed the hold permissible under the federal exception in accordance with Regulation CC. In such cases, only one exception notice is required, in accordance with § 229.13(g). This notice need only include the applicable federal exception as the reason the exception was invoked. For those categories of checks for which the state schedule is preempted by the federal schedule, only the federal exceptions may be used. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> State laws that provide maximum availability periods for categories of deposits that are not covered by the EFA Act would not be preempted. Thus, state funds availability laws that apply to funds in time and savings deposits are not affected by the EFA Act or this regulation. In addition, the availability schedules of several states apply to “items” deposited to an account. The term items may encompass deposits, such as nonnegotiable instruments, that are not subject to the Regulation CC availability schedules. Deposits that are not covered by Regulation CC continue to be subject to the state availability schedules. State laws that provide maximum availability periods for categories of institutions that are not covered by the EFA Act also would not be preempted. For example, a state law that governs money market mutual funds would not be affected by the EFA Act or this regulation. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> Generally, state rules governing the disclosure or notice of availability policies applicable to accounts also are preempted, if they are different from the federal rules. Nevertheless, a state law requiring disclosure of funds availability policies that apply to deposits other than “accounts,” such as savings or time deposits, are not inconsistent with the EFA Act and this subpart. Banks in these states would have to follow the state disclosure rules for these deposits. </p>

Although the lack of requirement for notice of nonpayment under this paragraph will create risks for the depositary bank, the inability to identify the depositary bank will generally be due to the depositary bank's, or a collecting bank's, failure to indorse as required by § 229.35(a). If the depositary bank failed to use the proper indorsement, it should bear the risks of less- than-expeditious return or not receiving notice of nonpayment in a timely manner. Similarly, where the inability to identify the depositary bank is due to indorsements or other information placed on the back of the check by the depositary bank's customer or other prior indorser, the depositary bank should bear the risk that it cannot charge a returned check back to that customer. </p>

By contrast, a reason such as “Refer to Maker” would be inappropriate in cases where a check is being returned due to the paying bank having already paid the item, where a check has been altered, or where a check is unauthorized.

For example, a bank that does not have the original check may have an image of both sides of the check, but the image may be insufficient or may not be in the proper format such that the bank cannot create a substitute check or provide required substitute check warranties. In that case, the check would be unavailable for return.

The paying bank may recover the settlement when the paying bank returns the check to the presenting bank. Under this regulation, however, the paying bank may return the check directly to the depositary bank or through returning banks that did not handle the check for forward collection. On these more efficient return paths, the paying bank does not recover the settlement made to the presenting bank. Thus, this paragraph requires the returning bank to settle for a returned check (either with the paying bank or another returning bank) in the same way that it would settle for a similar check for forward collection. To achieve uniformity, this paragraph applies even if the returning bank handled the check for forward collection. </p>

(See §§ 229.2(ggg), 229.30(b), and 229.31(c) and commentary thereto). The depositary bank's acceptance of electronic returned checks and electronic written notices of nonpayment is governed by the depositary bank's agreement with the banks sending the electronic returned check or electronic written notice of nonpayment to the depositary bank (or through the applicable clearinghouse rules). The agreement normally would specify the electronic address or receipt point at which the depositary bank accepts returned checks and written notices of nonpayment electronically, as well as what constitutes receipt of the returned checks and written notices of nonpayment. The agreement also may specify whether electronic returned checks must be separated from electronic checks sent for forward collection. </p>

This paragraph is derived from UCC 3–111, which specifies that presentment for payment may be made at the place specified in the instrument or, if there is none, at the place of business of the party to pay. In the case of returned checks, the depositary bank does not print the check and can only specify the place of “payment” of the returned check in its indorsement. </p>

If the address is too general to identify a particular location, then the depositary bank must accept paper returned checks and paper notices of nonpayment at any branch or head office consistent with the address. If, for example, the address is “New York, New York,” each branch in New York City must accept paper returned checks and paper notices of nonpayment.

This paragraph imposes an obligation to “pay” a returned check that is similar to the obligation to pay a forward collection check by a paying bank, except that the depositary bank may not return a returned check for which it is the depositary bank. Also, certain means of payment, such as remittance drafts, may be used only by agreement. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(E.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The depositary bank must pay for a returned check by the close of the banking day on which it received the returned check. The day on which a returned check is received is determined pursuant to UCC 4–108, which permits the bank to establish a cut-off hour, generally not earlier than 2 p.m. (local time of the depositary bank), and treat checks received after that hour as being received on the next banking day. If the depositary bank is unable to make payment to a returning bank or paying bank on the banking day that it receives the returned check, because the returning bank or paying bank is closed for a holiday or because the time when the depositary bank received the check is after the close of Fedwire, e.g., west coast banks with late cut-off hours, payment may be made on the next banking day of the bank receiving payment. </p>

(See § 229.30(a) and commentary thereto). Paragraph (f), however, sets forth remote deposit capture indemnities provided to banks that accept an original check for deposit for losses incurred by that depositary bank if the loss is due to the check having already been paid. Paragraph (a) sets forth warranties that are given only with respect to electronic checks and electronic returned checks. Paragraph (g) sets forth indemnities with respect to electronically created items. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)">B. 229.34(a) Warranties With Respect to Electronic Checks and Electronic Returned Checks </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Paragraph (a) of § 229.34 sets forth the warranties that a bank makes when transferring or presenting an electronic check or electronic returned check and receiving settlement or other consideration for it. Electronic checks and electronic returned checks sent pursuant to an agreement with the receiving bank are treated as checks subject to subpart C. Therefore, the warranties in § 229.34(a) are in addition to any warranties a bank makes under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) with respect to an electronic check or electronic returned check. For example, a bank that transfers and receives consideration for an electronic check that is derived from a remotely created check warrants that the remotely created check, from which the electronic check is derived, is authorized by the person on whose account the check is drawn. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The warranties in § 229.34(a)(1) relate to a subsequent bank's ability to create a substitute check. This paragraph provides a bank that creates a substitute check from an electronic check or electronic returned check with a warranty claim against any prior bank that transferred the electronic check or electronic returned check. The warranties in this paragraph correspond to the warranties made by a bank that transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check (a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check) for which it receives consideration. (See § 229.52 and commentary thereto). A bank that transfers an electronic check or electronic returned check that is an electronic representation of a substitute check also makes the warranties and indemnities in §§ 229.52 and 229.53. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> By agreement, a sending and receiving bank may vary the warranties the sending bank makes to the receiving bank for electronic images of or electronic information related to checks, for example, to provide that the bank transferring the check does not warrant that the electronic image or information is sufficient for creating a substitute check. (See § 229.37(a)). The variation by agreement, however, would not affect the rights of banks and persons that are not bound by the agreement. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)">C. 229.34(b) Transfer and Presentment Warranties With Respect to a Remotely Created Check </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank that transfers or presents a remotely created check and receives a settlement or other consideration warrants that the person on whose account the check is drawn authorized the issuance of the check in the amount stated on the check and to the payee stated on the check. The warranties are given only by banks and only to subsequent banks in the collection chain. The warranties ultimately shift liability for the loss created by an unauthorized remotely created check to the depositary bank. The depositary bank cannot assert the transfer and presentment warranties against a depositor. However, a depositary bank may, by agreement, allocate liability for such an item to the depositor and also may have a claim under other laws against that person. The Federal Trade Commission's Telemarketing Sales Rule (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-16/part-310" class="cfr external">16 CFR part 310</a>) contains further regulatory provisions regarding remotely created checks. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The scope of the transfer and presentment warranties for remotely created checks differs from that of the corresponding UCC warranty provisions in two respects. The UCC warranties are given by any person, including a nonbank depositor, that transfers a remotely created check and not just to a bank, as is the case under § 229.34(b). In addition, the UCC warranties state that the person on whose account the item is drawn authorized the issuance of the item in the amount for which the item is drawn. The § 229.34(b) warranties specifically cover the amount as well as the payee stated on the check. Neither the UCC warranties, nor the § 229.34(b) warranties, apply to the date stated on the remotely created check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank making the § 229.34(b) warranties may defend a claim asserting violation of the warranties by proving that the customer of the paying bank is precluded by UCC 4–406 from making a claim against the paying bank.

This paragraph gives the paying bank a warranty claim against the presenting bank for the amount of any excess settlement made on the basis of the amount demanded, plus expenses. If the amount demanded is understated, a paying bank discharges its settlement obligation under UCC 4–301 by paying the amount demanded, but remains liable for the amount by which the demand is understated; the presenting bank is nevertheless liable for expenses in resolving the adjustment. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> When checks or returned checks are transferred to a collecting bank, returning bank, or depositary bank, the transferor bank is not required to demand settlement, as is required upon presentment to the paying bank.

Section 229.34(f) provides the depositary bank that accepts the original check for deposit with a claim against the depositary bank that did not receive the original check because it permitted its customer to truncate it, received settlement or other consideration for the check, and did not receive a return of the check unpaid.

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section requires banks to use a standard form of indorsement when indorsing checks during the forward collection and return process. It is designed to facilitate the identification of the depositary bank and the prompt return of checks. The indorsement standard a bank must use depends on the type of check being indorsed. Paper checks must be indorsed in accordance with ANS X9.100–111. Substitute checks must be indorsed in accordance with ANS X9.100–140. Electronic checks must be indorsed in accordance ANS X9.100–187. The Board, however, may by rule or order determine that different standards apply. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> The parties sending and receiving a check may agree that different indorsement standards will apply to such checks.

If a subsequent substitute check is created in the course of collection or return, that substitute check will contain, in its image of the back of the previous substitute check, reproductions of indorsements that were sprayed or overlaid onto the previous item. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank might use check-processing equipment that captures an image of a check prior to spraying an indorsement onto that item. If the bank truncates that item, it should ensure that it also applies an indorsement to the item electronically. A reconverting bank satisfies its obligation to preserve all previously applied indorsements by overlaying a bank's indorsement that previously was applied electronically onto a substitute check that the reconverting bank creates. (See commentary to § 229.51(b)). </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> A depositary bank may want to include an address in its indorsement in order to limit the number of locations at which it must receive paper returned checks and paper notices of nonpayment. Banks should note, however, that § 229.33(c) requires a depositary bank to receive paper returned checks at the location(s) at which it receives paper forward-collection checks, as well as the other locations enumerated in § 229.33(c). (See § 229.33(c) and commentary thereto). </p>

Use of guarantee language in indorsements of paper checks, such as “P.E.G.” (“prior endorsements guaranteed”), may result in reducing the type size used in bank indorsements, thereby making them more difficult to read.

This paragraph extends the indorsement chain through the paying bank to the returning banks, and would permit each bank to recover from any prior indorser if the claimant bank does not receive payment for the check from a subsequent bank in the collection or return chain. For example, if a returning bank returned a check to an insolvent depositary bank, and did not receive the full amount of the check from the failed bank, the returning bank could obtain the unrecovered amount of the check from any bank prior to it in the collection and return chain including the paying bank. Because each bank in the collection and return chain could recover from a prior bank, any loss would fall on the first intermediary collecting bank that received the check from the depositary bank. To avoid circuity of actions, the returning bank could recover directly from the first collecting bank. Under the UCC, the first collecting bank might ultimately recover from the depositary bank's customer or from the other parties on the check. </p>

Where the paying bank is insolvent, and fails to pay the collecting bank, the collecting bank also could recover from a prior collecting bank under this paragraph, and the bank from which it recovered could in turn recover from its prior collecting bank until the loss settled on the depositary bank (which could recover from its customer). </p>

Written notice reasonably identifying the check and the basis for recovery is sufficient if the check is not available. Receipt of notice by the bank against which the claim is made is not a precondition to recovery by charge-back or other means; however, a bank may be liable for negligence for failure to provide timely notice. A paying bank or returning bank also may recover from a prior collecting bank as provided in §§ 229.31(a) and 229.32(b) (in those cases where the paying bank is unable to identify the depositary bank). This paragraph does not affect a paying bank's accountability for a check under UCC 4–215(a) and 4–302. Nor does this paragraph affect a collecting bank's accountability under UCC 4–214 and 4–215(d). A collecting bank becomes accountable upon receipt of final settlement as provided in the foregoing UCC sections. Final settlement in §§ 229.32(e), 229.33(e), and 229.36(c) is intended to be consistent with final settlement in the UCC (e.g., UCC 4–213, 4–214, and 4–215).

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section protects the rights of a customer depositing a check in a bank without requiring the words “pay any bank,” as required by the UCC (See UCC 4–201(b)). Use of this language in a depositary bank's indorsement will make it more difficult for other banks to identify the depositary bank. The applicable industry standard prohibits such material in subsequent collecting bank indorsements. The existence of a bank indorsement provides notice of the restrictive indorsement without any additional words. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)">D. 229.35(d) Indorsement for Depositary Bank </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This section permits a depositary bank to arrange with another bank to indorse checks. This practice may occur when a correspondent indorses for a respondent, or when the bank servicing an ATM or lock box indorses for the bank maintaining the account in which the check is deposited—<em>i.e.,</em> the depositary bank. If the indorsing bank applies the depositary bank's indorsement, checks will be returned to the depositary bank. An indorsing bank may by agreement with the depositary bank apply its own indorsement as the depositary bank indorsement. In that case, the actual depositary bank's own indorsement on the check (if any) should avoid the location reserved for the depositary bank. The actual depositary bank remains responsible for the availability and other requirements of subpart B, but the bank indorsing as depositary bank is considered the depositary bank for purposes of subpart C (e.g., for purposes of determining the right to assert a claim under § 229.33(a) for failure to return a check expeditiously and accepting paper checks under § 229.33(c)). The check will be returned, and notice of nonpayment will be given, to the bank indorsing as depositary bank. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> Because the depositary bank for subpart B purposes will desire prompt notice of nonpayment, its arrangement with the indorsing bank should provide for prompt notice of nonpayment. The bank indorsing as depositary bank may require the depositary bank to agree to take up the check if the check is not paid even if the depositary bank's indorsement does not appear on the check and it did not handle the check. The arrangement between the banks may constitute an agreement varying the effect of provisions of subpart C under § 229.37. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> A paying bank may agree to accept presentment of electronic checks. (See § 229.2(ggg) and commentary thereto). The paying bank's acceptance of such electronic checks is governed by the paying bank's agreement with the bank sending the electronic check to the paying bank. The terms of these agreements are determined by the parties and may include, for example, the electronic address or electronic receipt point at which the paying bank agrees to accept electronic checks, as well as when presentment occurs. The agreement also may specify whether electronic checks sent for forward collection must be separated from electronic returned checks. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)">B. 229.36(b) Receipt of Paper Checks </p>

Where the check is payable through a bank and the check is sent to that bank, the payable-through bank is the paying bank for purposes of this subpart, regardless of whether the paying bank must present the check to another bank or to a nonbank payor for payment. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> Delivery of paper checks may be made, and presentment is considered to occur, at a location (including a processing center) requested by the paying bank. This provision adopts the common law rule that the processing center acts as the agent of the paying bank to accept presentment and to begin the time for processing of the check. (See also UCC 4–204(c)). If a bank designates different locations for the presentment of forward collection paper checks bearing different routing numbers, for purposes of this paragraph it requests presentment of paper checks bearing a particular routing number only at the location designated for receipt of forward collection paper checks bearing that routing number. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)(b.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">b<span class="paren">.</span></span> If the check specifies the name and address of a branch or head office, or other location (such as a processing center), the paper check may be delivered to that office or other location. If the address is too general to identify a particular office, delivery may be made at any office consistent with the address. For example, if the address is “San Francisco, California,” each office in San Francisco must accept presentment of paper checks. The designation of an address on the check generally is in the control of the paying bank. </p>

In the case of a substitute check, delivery may be made at an office of the bank associated with the routing number in the electronic check from which it was derived. The office associated with the routing number of a bank is found in <em>American Bankers Association Key to Routing Numbers,</em> published by an agent of the American Bankers Association, which lists a city and state address for each routing number. Paper checks generally are handled by collecting banks on the basis of the nine-digit routing number contained in the MICR line (or on the basis of the fractional form routing number if the MICR line is obliterated) on the check, rather than the printed name or address. The definition of a paying bank in § 229.2(z) includes a bank designated by routing number, whether or not there is a name on the check, and whether or not any name is consistent with the routing number. Where a check is payable by one bank, but payable through another, the routing number is that of the payable-through bank, not that of the payor bank. In these cases, the payor bank has selected the payable-through bank as the point through which presentment of paper checks is to be made. </p>
<p class="indent-5" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)(c.)(ii.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">ii<span class="paren">.</span></span> There is no requirement in the regulation that the name and address on the check agree with the address associated with the routing number on the check.

<p class="indent-5" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)(c.)(iii.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">iii<span class="paren">.</span></span> In some cases, a paying bank may have several offices in the city associated with the routing number. In such case, it would not be reasonable or efficient to require the presenting bank to sort paper checks by more specific branch addresses that might be printed on the checks, and to deliver paper checks to each branch. A collecting bank normally would deliver all paper checks to one location. In cases where paper checks are delivered to a branch other than the branch on which they may be drawn, computer and courier communication among branches should permit the paying bank to determine quickly whether to pay the check. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)(d.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">d<span class="paren">.</span></span> If the paper check specifies the name of the paying bank but no address, the bank must accept delivery at any office. Where delivery is made by a person other than a bank, or where the routing number is not readable, delivery will be made based on the name and address of the paying bank on the check. If there is no address, delivery may be made at any office of the paying bank. This provision is consistent with UCC 3–111, which states that presentment for payment may be made at the place specified in the instrument, or, if there is none, at the place of business of the party to pay. </p>

In addition, this paragraph clarifies that this change does not affect the liability scheme under UCC 4–201 during forward collection of a check. That UCC section provides that, unless a contrary intent clearly appears, a bank is an agent or subagent of the owner of a check, but that Article 4 of the UCC applies even though a bank may have purchased an item and is the owner of it. This paragraph preserves the liability of a collecting bank to prior collecting banks and the depositary bank's customer for negligence during the forward collection of a check under the UCC, even though this paragraph provides that settlement between banks during forward collection is final rather than provisional. Settlement by a paying bank is not considered to be final payment for the purposes of UCC 4–215(a)(2) or (3), because a paying bank has the right to recover settlement from a returning bank or depositary bank to which it returns a check under this subpart. Other provisions of the UCC not superseded by this subpart, such as section 4–202, also continue to apply to the forward collection of a check and may apply to the return of a check.

This paragraph does not apply to paper checks presented for immediate payment over the counter. Settling for a paper check under this paragraph does not constitute final payment of the paper check under the UCC.

In addition, the paper check or checks must be presented at a location designated by the paying bank for receipt of paper checks for same-day settlement by 8 a.m. local time of that location. The designated presentment location must be a location at which the paying bank would be considered to have received a paper check under § 229.36(b). The paying bank may not designate a location solely for presentment of paper checks subject to settlement under this paragraph; by designating a location for the purposes of § 229.36(d), the paying bank agrees to accept paper checks at that location for the purposes of § 229.36(b). </p>

A paying bank and a presenting bank may agree that paper checks will be accepted for same-day settlement at an alternative location or that the cut-off time for same-day settlement be earlier or later than 8 a.m. local time of the presentment location. </p>

A paper check is considered presented when it is delivered to and payment is demanded at a location specified in paragraph (d)(1). Ordinarily, a presenting bank will find it necessary to contact the paying bank to determine the appropriate presentment location and any delivery instructions. Further, because presentment might not take place during the paying bank's banking day, a paying bank may establish reasonable delivery requirements to safeguard the paper checks presented, such as use of a night depository. If a presenting bank fails to follow reasonable delivery requirements established by the paying bank, it runs the risk that it will not have presented the paper checks. However, if no reasonable delivery requirements are established or if the paying bank does not make provisions for accepting delivery of checks during its non-business hours, leaving the paper checks at the presentment location constitutes effective presentment. </p>

If the collecting bank receives sorted paper checks from its respondent bank, consisting only of paper checks for which the collecting bank is the paying bank and that meet the requirements for same-day settlement under this paragraph, the collecting bank may not charge a fee for handling those paper checks and must make settlement in accordance with this paragraph. </p>

The settlement must be in the form of a credit to an account designated by the presenting bank at a Federal Reserve Bank (e.g., a Fedwire transfer), unless the presenting bank agrees with the paying bank to accept settlement in another form (e.g., credit to an account of the presenting bank at the paying bank or debit to an account of the paying bank at the presenting bank). The settlement must occur by the close of Fedwire on the business day the paper check is received by the paying bank.

Similarly, presenting a large volume of paper checks without prior notice could be viewed as not meeting reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing and therefore may not constitute presentment in good faith.

<p class="hd2-paragraph">XXIV. Section 229.38 Liability </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)">A. 229.38(a) Standard of Care; Liability; Measure of Damages </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The standard of care established by this section applies to any bank covered by the requirements of subpart C of the regulation. Thus, the standard of care applies to a paying bank under §§ 229.31, to a returning bank under § 229.32, to a depositary bank under §§ 229.33, to a bank erroneously receiving a returned check or written notice of nonpayment as depositary bank under § 229.33(f), and to a bank indorsing a check under § 229.35. The standard of care is similar to the standard imposed by UCC 1–203 and 4–103(a) and includes a duty to act in good faith, as defined in § 229.2(nn) of this regulation. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank not meeting this standard of care is liable to the depositary bank, the depositary bank's customer, the owner of the check, or another party to the check. The depositary bank's customer is usually a depositor of a check in the depositary bank (but see § 229.35(d)). The measure of damages provided in this section (loss incurred up to amount of check, less amount of loss party would have incurred even if bank had exercised ordinary care) is based on UCC 4–103(e) (amount of the item reduced by an amount that could not have been realized by the exercise of ordinary care), as limited by 4–202(c) (bank is liable only for its own negligence and not for actions of subsequent banks in chain of collection). This subpart does not absolve a collecting bank of liability to prior collecting banks under UCC 4–201. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> Under this measure of damages, a depositary bank or other person must show that the damage incurred results from the negligence proved. For example, the depositary bank may not simply claim that its customer will not accept a charge-back of a returned check, but must prove that it could not charge back when it received the returned check and could have charged back if no negligence had occurred, and must first attempt to collect from its customer. (See <em>Marcoux</em> v. <em>Van Wyk,</em> 572 F.2d 651 (8th Cir. 1978); <em>Appliance Buyers Credit Corp.</em> v. <em>Prospect Nat'l Bank,</em> 708 F.2d 290 (7th Cir. 1983)). Generally, a paying or returning bank's liability would not be reduced because the depositary bank did not place a hold on its customer's deposit before it learned of nonpayment of the check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph also states that it does not affect a paying bank's liability to its customer. Under UCC 4–402, for example, a paying bank is liable to its customer for wrongful dishonor, which is different from failure to exercise ordinary care and has a different measure of damages. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)">B. 229.38(b) Paying Bank's Failure To Make Timely Return </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(B.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> Section 229.31(b) imposes requirements on the paying bank for expeditious return of a check and leaves in place the UCC deadlines (as they may be modified by § 229.31(g)), which may allow return at a different time. This paragraph clarifies that the paying bank could be liable for failure to meet either standard, but not for failure to meet both. The regulation intends to preserve the paying bank's accountability for missing its midnight or other deadline under the UCC (e.g., sections 4–215 and 4–302), provisions that are not incorporated in this regulation, but may be useful in establishing the time of final payment by the paying bank. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(C.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> This paragraph establishes a “pure” comparative negligence standard for liability under subpart C of this regulation. This comparative negligence rule may have particular application where a paying bank or returning bank delays in returning a check because of difficulty in identifying the depositary bank, where the depositary bank has failed to exercise ordinary care in applying its indorsement. </p>

<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(D.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> ANS X9.100–140 provides that an image of an original check must be reduced in size when placed on the first substitute check associated with that original check. (The image thereafter would be constant in size on any subsequent substitute check that might be created.) Because of this size reduction, the location of an indorsement, particularly a depositary bank indorsement, applied to an original paper check likely will change when the first reconverting bank creates a substitute check that contains that indorsement within the image of the original paper check. If the indorsement was applied to the original paper check in accordance with ANS X9.100–111's location requirements for indorsements applied to existing paper checks, and if the size reduction of the image causes the placement of the indorsement to no longer be consistent with ANS X9.100–111's requirements, then the reconverting bank bears the liability for any loss that results from the shift in the placement of the indorsement. Such a loss could result either because the original indorsement applied in accordance with ANS X9.100–111 is rendered illegible by a subsequent indorsement that a reconverting bank later applies to the substitute check in accordance with ANS X9.100–140, or because a subsequent bank receiving a substitute check cannot apply its indorsement to the substitute check legibly in accordance with ANS X9.100–111 as a result of the shift in the previous indorsement. </p>

Paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of § 229.39 are derived from UCC 4–216. They are intended to apply to all banks. Like UCC 4–216, paragraphs (a), (b), and (d) of § 229.39 are intended to establish the point in the collection process at which collection or return of a check should be either stopped or continued when a particular bank suspends payments. Section 229.39(a) sets forth the circumstances under which the receiver must stop collection or return and, instead, send the check back to the bank or customer that transferred the check. Section 229.39(b) sets forth the circumstances under which the collection or return of the check should continue. Paragraphs (a) and (b) of § 229.39 are not intended to confer upon banks preferential positions in the event of bank failures over general depositors or any other creditor of the failed bank. (See UCC 4–216, cmt. 1). </p>

Where the law (or a contract) requires production of the original check, production of a legally equivalent substitute check would satisfy that requirement. A person that receives a substitute check cannot be assessed costs associated with the creation of the substitute check, absent agreement to the contrary. </p>

A substitute check need not capture other characteristics of the check, such as watermarks, microprinting, or other physical security features that cannot survive the imaging process or decorative images, in order to meet the accuracy requirement. Conversely, some security features that are latent on the original check might become visible as a result of the check imaging process. For example, the original check might have a faint representation of the word “void” that will appear more clearly on a photocopied or electronic image of the check. Provided the inclusion of the clearer version of the word on the image used to create a substitute check did not obscure the required information listed above, a substitute check that contained such information could be the legal equivalent of an original check under § 229.51(a). However, if a person suffered a loss due to receipt of such a substitute check instead of the original check, that person could have an indemnity claim under § 229.53 and, in the case of a consumer, an expedited recredit claim under § 229.54. </p>

Indorsements applied physically to the original check before an image of the check was captured would be preserved through the image of the back of the original check that a substitute check must contain. If a bank sprays an indorsement onto a paper check <em>after</em> it captures an image of the check, it should ensure that it applies an indorsement to the item electronically, if it transfers the check as an electronic check or electronic returned check. (See paragraph 4 of commentary to section 229.35(a)). A reconverting bank satisfies its obligation to preserve all previously applied indorsements by physically applying (overlaying) electronic indorsements onto a substitute check that the reconverting bank creates. A reconverting bank is not responsible for obtaining indorsements that persons that previously handled the check in any form should have applied but did not apply. </p>

The reconverting-bank and truncating-bank routing numbers on the front of a substitute check and, if the reconverting bank is the paying bank or a bank that rejected a check submitted for deposit, the reconverting bank's routing number on the back of a substitute check are for identification only and are not indorsements or acceptances. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)">A. 229.52(a) Warranty Content and Provision </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> The responsibility for providing the substitute-check warranties begins with the reconverting bank. In the case of a substitute check created by a bank, the reconverting bank starts the flow of warranties when it transfers, presents, or returns a substitute check for which it receives consideration or when it rejects a check submitted for deposit and returns to its customer a substitute check. A bank that receives a substitute check created by a nonbank starts the flow of warranties when it transfers, presents, or returns for consideration either the substitute check it received or an electronic or paper representation of that substitute check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> To ensure that warranty protections flow all the way through to the ultimate recipient of a substitute check or paper or electronic representation thereof, any subsequent bank that transfers, presents, or returns for consideration either the substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of the substitute check is responsible to subsequent transferees for the warranties. Any warranty recipient could bring a claim for a breach of a substitute-check warranty if it received either the actual substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> The substitute-check warranties and indemnity are not given under sections 229.52 and 229.53 by a bank that truncates the original check and by agreement transfers an electronic check to a subsequent bank for consideration. However, the warranties in § 229.34(a) would apply to the transfer of an electronic check, and those warranties may be varied by agreement between the parties. A bank that is a truncating bank under § 229.2(eee)(2) because it accepts a deposit of a check electronically might be subject to a claim by another depositary bank that accepts the original check for deposit. (See § 229.34(f) and commentary thereto). </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Example.</em>  A bank that receives an electronic check and uses it to create substitute checks is the reconverting bank and, when it transfers, presents, or returns that substitute check, becomes the first warrantor with respect to the substitute check warranties. That bank, however, may have similar warranty claims with respect to the electronic check under § 229.34(a) against the bank that transferred the electronic check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(4.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">4<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank need not affirmatively make the warranties because they attach automatically when a bank transfers, presents, or returns the substitute check (or a representation thereof) for which it receives consideration. Because a substitute check transferred, presented, or returned for consideration is warranted to be the legal equivalent of the original check and thereby subject to existing laws as if it were the original check, all UCC and other Regulation CC warranties that apply to the original check also apply to the substitute check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(5.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">5<span class="paren">.</span></span> The legal-equivalence warranty by definition must be linked to a particular substitute check. When an original check is truncated, the check may move from electronic form to substitute-check form and then back again, such that there would be multiple substitute checks associated with one original check. When a check changes form multiple times in the collection or return process, the first reconverting bank and subsequent banks that transfer, present, or return the first substitute check (or a paper or electronic representation of the first substitute check) warrant the legal equivalence of only the first substitute check. If a bank receives an electronic representation of a substitute check and uses that representation to create a second substitute check, the second reconverting bank and subsequent transferees of the second substitute check (or a representation thereof) warrant the legal equivalence of both the first and second substitute checks. A reconverting bank would not be liable for a warranty breach under section 229.52 if the legal-equivalence defect is the fault of a subsequent bank that handled the substitute check, either as a substitute check or in other paper or electronic form. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(6.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">6<span class="paren">.</span></span> The warranty in § 229.52(a)(1)(ii), which addresses multiple payment requests for the same check, is not linked to a particular substitute check but rather is given by each bank handling the substitute check, an electronic representation of a substitute check, or a subsequent substitute check created from an electronic representation of a substitute check. All banks that transfer, present, or return a substitute check (or a paper or electronic representation thereof) therefore provide the warranty regardless of whether the ultimate demand for double payment is based on the original check, the substitute check, or some other electronic or paper representation of the substitute or original check, and regardless of the order in which the duplicative payment requests occur. This warranty is given by the banks that transfer, present, or return a substitute check even if the demand for duplicative payment results from a fraudulent substitute check about which the warranting bank had no knowledge. (See also § 229.34(a)(1)(ii)). </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Example.</em>  A nonbank depositor truncates a check and in lieu of the check sends an electronic check to both Bank A and Bank B. Bank A and Bank B each use the check information that it received electronically to create a substitute check, which it presents to Bank C for payment. Bank A and Bank B are both reconverting banks and each made the substitute-check warranties when it presented a substitute check to and received payment from Bank C. Bank C could pursue a warranty claim for the loss it suffered as a result of the duplicative payment against either Bank A or Bank B. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(7.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">7<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank that rejects a check submitted for deposit and, instead of the original check, provides its customer with a substitute check makes the warranties in § 229.52(a)(1). As noted in the commentary to § 229.2(ccc), the Check 21 Act contemplates that nonbank persons that receive substitute checks (or representations thereof) from a bank will receive warranties and indemnities with respect to the checks. A reconverting bank that provides a substitute check to its depositor after it has rejected the check submitted for deposit may not have received consideration for the substitute check. In order to prevent banks from being able to transfer a check the bank truncated and then reconverted without providing substitute check warranties, the regulation provides that a bank that rejects a check submitted for deposit but provides its customer with a substitute check (or a paper or electronic representation of a substitute check) makes the warranties set forth in § 229.52(a)(1) regardless of whether the bank received consideration. </p>
<p><em class="paragraph-heading">Example.</em>  A bank's customer submits a check for deposit at an ATM that captures an image of the check and sends the image electronically to the bank. After reviewing the item, the bank rejects the item submitted for deposit. Instead of providing the original check to its customer, the bank provides a substitute check to its customer. This bank is the reconverting bank with respect to the substitute check and makes the warranties described in § 229.52(a)(1) regardless of whether the bank previously extended credit to its customer. (See commentary to § 229.2(ccc)). </p>

A bank that pays an indemnity would in turn have an indemnity claim regardless of whether it received the substitute check or a paper or electronic representation of the substitute check. The indemnity would not apply to a person that handled only the original check or a paper or electronic image of the original check that was not derived from a substitute check. </p>

As a result of this duplicative charge, the paying bank dishonored several subsequently presented checks that it otherwise would have paid and charged the drawer returned-check fees. The payees of the returned checks also charged the drawer returned-check fees. The drawer would have a warranty claim against any of the warranting banks, including its bank, for breach of the warranty described in § 229.52(a)(1)(ii). The drawer also could assert an indemnity claim. Because there is only one original check for any payment transaction, if the collecting bank and presenting bank had collected the original check instead of using a substitute check the bank would have been asked to make only one payment. The drawer could assert its warranty and indemnity claims against the paying bank, because that is the bank with which the drawer has a customer relationship and the drawer has received an indemnity from that bank. The drawer could recover from the indemnifying bank the amount of the erroneous charge, as well as the amount of the returned-check fees charged by both the paying bank and the payees of the returned checks. If the drawer's account were an interest-bearing account, the drawer also could recover any interest lost on the erroneously debited amount and the erroneous returned-check fees. The drawer also could recover its expenditures for representation in connection with the claim.

However, the drawer would not have a substitute check warranty claim because the substitute check was the legal equivalent of the original check and no person was asked to pay the substitute check more than once.

<p class="hd3-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)">A. 229.54(a) Circumstances Giving Rise to a Claim </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(1.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">1<span class="paren">.</span></span> A consumer may make a claim for expedited recredit under this section only for a substitute check that he or she has received and for which the bank charged his or her deposit account. As a result, checks used to access loans, such as credit card checks or home equity line of credit checks, that are reconverted to substitute checks would not give rise to an expedited recredit claim, unless such a check was returned unpaid and the bank charged the consumer's deposit account for the amount of the returned check. In addition, a consumer who received only a statement that contained images of multiple substitute checks per page would not be entitled to make an expedited recredit claim, although he or she could seek redress under other provisions of law, such as § 229.52 or U.C.C. 4–401. However, a consumer who originally received only a statement containing images of multiple substitute checks per page but later received a substitute check, such as in response to a request for a copy of a check shown in the statement, could bring a claim if the other expedited recredit criteria were met. Although a consumer must at some point have received a substitute check to make an expedited recredit claim, the consumer need not be in possession of the substitute check at the time he or she submits the claim. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(2.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">2<span class="paren">.</span></span> A consumer must in good faith assert that the bank improperly charged the consumer's account for the substitute check or that the consumer has a warranty claim for the substitute check (or both). The warranty in question could be a substitute-check warranty described in section 229.52 or any other warranty that a bank provides with respect to a check under other law. A consumer could, for example, have a warranty claim under section 229.34(a) or (d), which contain returned-check warranties that are made to the owner of the check. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> A consumer's recovery under the expedited recredit section is limited to the amount of his or her loss, up to the amount of the substitute check subject to the claim, plus interest if the consumer's account is an interest-bearing account. The consumer's loss could include fees that resulted from the allegedly incorrect charge, such as bounced check fees that were imposed because the improper charge caused the bank to dishonor subsequently presented checks that it otherwise would have honored. A consumer who suffers a total loss greater than the amount of the substitute check plus interest could attempt to recover the remainder of that loss by bringing warranty, indemnity, or other claim under this subpart or other applicable law. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Examples. </p>
<p class="indent-4" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)(a.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">a<span class="paren">.</span></span> A consumer who received a substitute check believed that he or she wrote the check for $150, but the bank charged his or her account for $1,500. The amount on the substitute check the consumer received is illegible. If the substitute check contained a blurry image of what was a legible original check, the consumer could have a claim for a breach of the legal equivalence warranty in addition to an improper charge claim. Because the amount of the check cannot be determined from the substitute check provided to the consumer, the consumer, if acting in good faith, could assert that the production of the original check or a better copy of the original check is necessary to determine the validity of the claim. The consumer in this case could attempt to recover his or her losses by using the expedited recredit procedure. The consumer's losses recoverable under § 229.54 could include the $1,350 he or she believed was incorrectly charged plus any improperly charged fees associated with that charge, up to $150 (plus foregone interest on the amount of the consumer's loss if the account was an interest-bearing account). The consumer could recover any additional losses, if any, under other law, such as U.C.C. 4–401 and 4–402. </p>

Under those circumstances, the consumer, if acting in good faith, could assert that the charge was improper, that he or she therefore had incurred a loss in the amount of the check (plus foregone interest if the account was an interest-bearing account), and that he or she needed the original check to determine the validity of the forgery claim. By contrast, if the signature on the substitute check obviously was forged (for example, if the forger signed a name other than that of the account holder) and there was no other defect with the substitute check, the consumer would not need the original check or a sufficient copy to determine the fact of the forgery and thus would not be able to make an expedited recredit claim under this section.

In-person delivery would include, for example, making an account statement or substitute check available at the bank for the consumer's retrieval under an arrangement agreed to by the consumer. In the case of a mailed statement or substitute check, the 40-day period should be calculated from the postmark on the envelope. In the case of in-person delivery, the 40-day period should be calculated from the earlier of the calendar day on which delivery occurred or the bank first made the statement or substitute check available for the consumer's retrieval. </p>

A bank that receives a timely oral claim and then requires the consumer to submit the claim in writing may require the consumer to submit the written claim within 10 business days of the bank's receipt of the timely oral claim. If the consumer's oral claim was timely and the consumer's written claim was received within the 10-day period for submitting the claim in writing, the consumer would satisfy the requirement of § 229.54(b)(1) to submit his or her claim within 40 days, even if the bank received the written claim after that 40-day period. </p>

The paying bank would have a warranty claim against the presenting bank that transferred the defective substitute check to it and against any previous transferring bank(s) that handled that substitute check or another paper or electronic representation of the check.

A bank that uses the model language is deemed to comply with the disclosure content requirement(s) for which it uses the model language, provided the information in the disclosure accurately describes the bank's policies and practices. A bank also may include in its disclosure additional information relating to substitute checks that is not required by this section. </p>
<p class="indent-3" id="p-Appendix-E-to-Part-229(VI.)(A.)(3.)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy">3<span class="paren">.</span></span> A bank may, by agreement or at the consumer's request, provide the disclosure required by this section in a language other than English, provided that the bank makes a complete English notice available at the consumer's request. </p>

Otherwise, the bank must provide the disclosure no later than the time at which the bank provides a substitute check in response to the consumer's request. It would not be feasible for a bank to provide notice to the consumer at the time of the request if, for example, the bank did not know at the time of the request whether it would provide a substitute check in response to that request, regardless of the form of the consumer's request. It also would not be feasible for a bank to provide notice at the time of the request if the consumer's request was mailed to the bank or made by telephone, even if the bank knew when it received the request that it would provide a substitute check in response. A bank's provision to the consumer of something other a substitute check, such as a photocopy of a check or a statement containing images of multiple substitute checks per page, does not trigger the notice requirement. </p>

The EFA Act keys the requirement to pay interest to the time the depositary bank receives provisional credit for a check. Provisional credit is a term used in the U.C.C. that is derived from the Code's concept of provisional settlement. (See U.C.C. 4–214 and 4–215.) Provisional credit is credit that is subject to charge-back if the check is returned unpaid; once the check is finally paid, the right to charge back expires and the provisional credit becomes final. Under Subpart C, a paying bank no longer has an automatic right to charge back credits given in settlement of a check, and the concept of provisional settlement is no longer useful and has been eliminated by the regulation. Accordingly, this section uses the term credit rather than provisional credit, and this section applies regardless of whether a credit would be provisional or final under the U.C.C. Credit does not include a bookkeeping entry (sometimes referred to as deferred credit) that does not represent funds actually available for the bank's use.</p></div>

<p class="hd2-paragraph">Uniform Commercial Code, Section 4–213(5) </p>
<p>Section 4–213(5) of the Uniform Commercial Code (“U.C.C.”) provides that money deposited in a bank is available for withdrawal as of right at the opening of business of the banking day after deposit. Although the language “deposited in a bank” is unclear, arguably it is broader than the language “made in person to an employee of the depositary bank”, which conditions the next-day availability of cash under Regulation CC (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-229.10#p-229.10(a)(1)" class="cfr external">§ 229.10(a)(1)</a>). Under Regulation CC, deposits of cash that are not made in person to an employee of the depositary bank must be made available by the second business day after the banking day of deposit (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-229.10#p-229.10(a)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 229.10(a)(2)</a>). Therefore, this provision of the U.C.C. may call for the availability of certain cash deposits in a shorter time than provided in Regulation CC. </p>
<p>This provision of the U.C.C., however, is subject to Section 4–103(1), which provides, in part, that “the effect of the provisions of this Article may be varied by agreement * * *.” (The Regulation CC funds availability requirements may not be varied by agreement.) U.C.C. Section 4–213(5) supersedes the Regulation CC provision in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-229.10#p-229.10(a)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 229.10(a)(2)</a>, but a depositary bank may not agree with its customer under section 4–103(1) of the Code to extend availability beyond the time periods provided in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-229.10#p-229.10(a)" class="cfr external">§ 229.10(a)</a> of Regulation CC. </p>

<p>The Board has been requested, in accordance with <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-229.20#p-229.20(d)" class="cfr external">§ 229.20(d)</a> of Regulation CC (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-229" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 229</a>), to determine whether the Expedited Funds Availability Act (the “Act”) and subpart B (and in connection therewith, subpart A) of Regulation CC preempt the provisions of California law concerning availability of funds. This preemption determination specifies those provisions of the California funds availability law that supersede the Act and Regulation CC. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4–213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.) </p>
<p>California has four separate sets of regulations establishing maximum availability schedules. The regulations applicable to commercial banks and branches of foreign banks located in California (Cal. Admin. Code tit. 10, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-10.190401" class="cfr external">§§ 10.190401–10.190402</a>) were promulgated by the Superintendent of Banks. The regulations applicable to savings banks and savings and loan associations (Cal. Admin. Code tit. 10, <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-106.200" class="cfr external">§§ 106.200–106.202</a>) were adopted by the Savings and Loan Commissioner. The regulations applicable to credit unions (Cal. Admin. Code tit. 10, section 901) and to industrial loan companies (Cal. Admin. Code tit. 10, section 1101) were adopted by the Commissioner of Corporations. </p>
<p>All the regulations were adopted pursuant to California Financial Code section 866.5 and California Commercial Code section 4213(4)(a), under which the appropriate state regulatory agency for each depository institution must issue administrative regulations to define a reasonable time for permitting customers to draw on items received for deposit in the customer's account. California Financial Code section 867 also establishes availability periods for funds deposited by cashier's check, certified check, teller's check, or depository check under certain circumstances. Finally, California Financial Code section 866.2 establishes disclosure requirements. </p>
<p>The Board's determination with respect to these California laws and regulations governing the funds availability requirements applicable to depository institutions in California are as follows. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Commercial Banks and Branches of Foreign Banks </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p>The California State Banking Department regulations, which apply to California state commercial banks, California national banks, and California branch offices of foreign banks, provide that a depositary bank shall make funds deposited into a deposit account available for withdrawal as provided in Regulation CC with certain exceptions. The funds availability schedules in Regulation CC apply only to <em>accounts</em> as defined in Regulation CC, which generally consist of transaction accounts. The California funds availability law and regulations apply to accounts as defined by Regulation CC as well as savings accounts (other than time accounts), as defined in the Board's Regulation D (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-204.2#p-204.2(d)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 204.2(d)</a>). (Note, however, that under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-229.19#p-229.19(e)" class="cfr external">§ 229.19(e)</a> of Regulation CC, <em>Holds on other funds,</em> the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined as <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC in certain circumstances.) </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Availability Schedules </p>
<div id="p-Appendix-F-to-Part-229(Temporary%20schedule)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-F-to-Part-229(Temporary%20schedule)" data-title="Appendix-F-to-Part-229 “Temporary schedule”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">Temporary schedule.</em>   Regulation CC provides that, until September 1, 1990, nonlocal checks must be made available for withdrawal by the seventh business day after the banking day of deposit, except for certain nonlocal checks listed in appendix B–1, which must be made available within a shorter time (by the fifth business day following deposit for those California checks listed). Under the temporary schedule in the California regulations, a depositary bank with a four-digit routing symbol of 1210 (“1210 bank”) or of 1220 (“1220 bank”) that receives for deposit a check drawn on a nonlocal, in-state commercial bank or foreign bank branch<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-F-to-Part-229-footnote-1" id="Appendix-F-to-Part-229-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  must make the funds available for withdrawal by the fourth business day after the day of deposit. The California regulations provide that 1210 and 1220 banks must make deposited checks drawn on nonlocal in-state thrifts (defined as savings and loan associations, savings banks, and credit unions) available by the fifth business day after deposit. In addition, California law provides that all other depositary banks must make deposited checks drawn on a nonlocal in-state commercial bank or foreign bank branch available by the fifth business day after deposit and checks drawn on nonlocal in-state thrifts available by the sixth business day after deposit. To the extent that these schedules provide for shorter holds than Regulation CC and its appendix B–1, the state schedules supersede the federal schedules.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-F-to-Part-229-footnote-2" id="Appendix-F-to-Part-229-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  For example, the California four-day schedule that applies to checks drawn on in-state nonlocal commercial banks or foreign bank branches and deposited in a 1210 or 1220 bank would be shorter than and would supersede the federal schedules. </p>


<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The California regulations do not specify whether the state schedules apply to deposits of checks at nonproprietary ATMs. Under the temporary schedules in Regulation CC, deposits at nonproprietary ATMs must be made available for withdrawal by the seventh business day following deposit. To the extent that the California schedules provide for shorter availability for deposits at nonproprietary ATMs, they would supersede the temporary schedule in Regulation CC for deposits at nonproprietary ATMs specified in <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-229.11#p-229.11(d)" class="cfr external">§ 229.11(d)</a>. </p>

Under the permanent schedule in the California regulations, a depositary bank with a four-digit routing symbol of 1210 or of 1220 that receives for deposit a check drawn on a nonlocal, in-state commercial bank or foreign bank branch must make the funds available for withdrawal by the fourth business day after the day of deposit. These state schedules provide for shorter hold periods than and thus supersede the federal schedules. </p>

The Regulation CC next-day availability requirement for cashier's checks and teller's checks applies only to those checks issued to a customer of the bank or acquired from the bank for remittance purposes. To the extent that the state second-day availability requirement applies to cashier's and teller's checks issued to a non-customer of the bank for other than remittance purposes, the state two-day requirement supersedes the federal local and nonlocal schedules. </p>

Section 229.19(b) of Regulation CC provides that funds must be made available at the start of the business day. In those cases where federal and state law provide for holds for the same number of days, to the extent that the California regulations allow funds to be made available later in the day than does Regulation CC, the federal law would preempt state law. </p>

<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-F-to-Part-229(Exceptions%20to%20the%20availability%20schedules)" data-title="Appendix-F-to-Part-229 “Exceptions to the availability schedules”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">Exceptions to the availability schedules.</em>   Under the state preemption standards of Regulation CC (see § 229.20(c) and accompanying Commentary), for deposits subject to the state availability schedules, a state exception may be used to extend the state availability schedule up to the federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held up to the federal availability schedule limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold under any federal exception that can be applied to the deposit. If no state exceptions exist, then no exceptions holds may be placed on deposits covered by state schedules. Thus, to the extent that California law provides for exceptions to the California schedules that supersede Regulation CC, those exceptions may be applied in order to extend the state availability schedules up to the federal availability schedules or such later time as is permitted by a federal exception. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Disclosures </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">California law (Cal. Fin. Code § 866.2) requires depository institutions to provide written disclosures of their general availability policies to potential customers prior to opening any deposit account. The law also requires that preprinted deposit slips and ATM deposit envelopes contain a conspicuous summary of the general policy. Finally, the law requires depository institutions to provide specific notice of the time the customer may withdraw funds deposited by check or similar instrument into a deposit account if the funds are not available for immediate withdrawal. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section 229.20(c)(2) of Regulation CC provides that inconsistency may exist when a state law provides for disclosures or notices concerning funds availability relating to accounts. California Financial Code § 866.2 requires disclosures that differ from those required by Regulation CC and, therefore, is preempted to the extent that it applies to <em>accounts</em> as defined in Regulation CC. The state law continues to apply to savings accounts and other accounts not governed by Regulation CC disclosure requirements. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The California Department of Savings and Loan regulations, which apply to California savings and loan associations and California savings banks, provide that a depositary bank shall make funds deposited into a transaction or non-transaction account available for withdrawal as provided in Regulation CC. The funds availability schedules in Regulation CC apply only to <em>accounts</em> as defined in Regulation CC, which generally consist of transaction accounts. The California funds availability law and regulations apply to accounts as defined by Regulation CC as well as savings accounts as defined in the Board's Regulation D (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-204.2#p-204.2(d)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 204.2(d)</a>).

To the extent that California Financial Code § 866.2 requires disclosures that differ from those required by Regulation CC and apply to <em>accounts</em> as defined in Regulation CC (generally, transaction accounts), the California law is preempted by Regulation CC. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Department of Savings and Loan regulations provide that for those non-transaction accounts covered by state law but not by federal law, disclosures in accordance with Regulation CC will be deemed to comply with the state law disclosure requirements.

State regulations are stated in terms of availability at the start of the business day subsequent to the number of days specified in the regulation.</p></div>
</div>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The California law and regulations govern the availability of funds to “demand deposits, negotiable order of withdrawal draft accounts, savings deposits subject to automatic transfers, share draft accounts, and all savings deposits and share accounts, other than time deposits.” (California Financial Code section 886(b)) The federal preemption of state funds availability laws only applies to <em>accounts</em> subject to Regulation CC, which generally includes transaction accounts. Thus, the California funds availability regulations continue to apply to deposits in savings and other accounts (such as accounts in which the account-holder is another bank) that are no <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under § 229.19(e) of Regulation CC, <em>Holds on other funds,</em> the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined as <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC in certain circumstances.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The California law applies to any <em>Item</em> (California Financial Code section 866.5 and California Commercial Code section 4213(4)(a)). The California Commercial Code defines <em>item</em> to mean <em>any instrument for the payment of money even though it is not negotiable * * *</em> (Cal. Com. Code section 4104(g)). This term is broader in scope than the definition of <em>check</em> in the Act and Regulation CC. The Commissioner's regulations, however, define the term <em>item</em> to include checks, negotiable orders of withdrawal, share drafts, warrants, and money orders. As limited by the state regulations, the state law applies only to instruments that are also <em>checks</em> as defined in § 229.2(k) of Regulation CC. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Availability Schedules </p>
</div>
<div id="p-Appendix-F-to-Part-229(Temporary%20schedule)">

This time period is shorter than the seventh business day availability required for nonlocal checks under § 229.11(c) of Regulation CC, although it is not shorter than the schedules for nonlocal checks set forth in § 229.11(c)(2) and appendix B–1 of Regulation CC. Thus, the state scheduled for in-state nonlocal checks supersede the federal schedule to the extent that they apply to an item payable by a California institution that is defined as a nonlocal check under Regulation CC, and is not subject to reduced schedules under § 229.11(c)(2) and appendix B–1. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Under the California regulations, credit unions and industrial loan companies must provide next-day availability to first-indorsed items issued by any federally-insured institution. This regulatory requirement, however, has been superseded by section 867 of the California Financial Code, which requires depository institutions to make funds deposited by cashier's check, teller's check, certified checks, or depository check available for withdrawal on the second business day following deposit, if certain conditions are met. This requirement became effective January 1, 1988. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Regulation CC next-day availability requirement for cashier's checks and teller's checks applies only to those checks issued for remittance purposes. To the extent that the state second business day availability requirement applies to cashier's and teller's checks issued for other than remittance purposes, the state two-day requirement supersedes the federal local and nonlocal schedules. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The California regulations do not specify whether they apply to deposits of checks at nonproprietary ATMs. Under the temporary schedule in Regulation CC, deposits at nonproprietary ATMs must be made available for withdrawal at the start of the seventh business day after deposit. To the extent that the California schedules provide for shorter availability for deposits at nonproprietary ATMs, they would supersede the temporary schedule in Regulation CC for deposits at nonproprietary ATMs specified in § 229.11(d). </p>

California law supersedes the fedeal law in that the state law does not condition next-day availability on receipt at a staffed teller station or use of a special deposit slip. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">California credit unions and industrial loan companies must provide second business day availability to checks drawn on the depositary bank. Regulation CC requires next-day availability for checks deposited in a branch of the depositary bank and drawn on the same or another branch of the same bank if both branches are located in the same state or the same check processing region. Thus, generally, the Regulation CC rule for availability of on us checks preempts the California regulations. To the extent, however, that an on us check is (1) drawn on an out-of-state branch of the depositary bank that is not in the same check processing region as the branch in which it was deposited, or (2) deposited at an off-premises ATM or another facility of the depositary bank that is not considered a branch under federal law, the state regulation supersedes the Regulation CC availability requirements. </p>

In all cases where the federal availability schedule preempts the state schedule, only the federal exceptions will apply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule (e.g., in-state nonlocal checks under the temporary schedule; cashier's or teller's checks that are not deposited with a special deposit slip or at a staff teller station), the state exceptions may be used to extend the state availability schedule up to the federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held up to the federal availability limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold under any federal exception that can be applied to the deposit. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customer in accordance with § 229.13(g) of Regulation CC. </p>

This preemption determination specifies those provisions of the Connecticut funds availability law that supersede the Act and Regulation CC. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4–213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In 1987, Connecticut amended its statute governing funds availability (Conn. Gen. Stat. section 36–9v), which requires Connecticut depository institutions to make funds deposited in a checking, time, interest, or savings account available for withdrawal with specified periods. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Generally, the Connecticut statute, as amended, provides that items deposited in a checking, time, interest, or savings account at a depository institution must be available for withdrawal in accordance with the following table: </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Connecticut statute governs the availability of funds deposited in savings and time accounts, as well as <em>accounts</em> as defined in § 229.2(a) of Regulation CC. The federal preemption of state funds availability requirements only applies to <em>accounts</em> subject to Regulation CC, which generally consist of trasaction accounts. Regulation CC does not affect the Connecticut statute to the extent that the state law applies to deposits in savings and other accounts (including transaction accounts where the account holder is a bank, foreign bank or the U.S. Treasury) that are not <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under § 229.19(e) of Regulation CC, <em>Holds on other funds,</em> the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined as <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC, in certain circumstances.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Connecticut statute applies to <em>items</em> deposited in accounts. This term encompasses instruments that are not defined as <em>checks</em> in Regulation CC (§ 229.2(k)), such as nonnegotiable instruments, and are therefore not subject to Regulation CC's provisions governing funds availability. Those items that are subject to Connecticut law but are not subject to Regulation CC will continue to be covered by the state availability schedules and exceptions. </p>

Accordingly, the Connecticut law supersedes Regulation CC with respect to nonlocal checks (other than checks covered by appendix B–1) deposited in <em>accounts</em> until the federal permanent availability schedules take effect on September 1, 1990. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Connecticut statute does not specify whether it applies to deposits of checks at nonproprietary ATMs. Under the temporary schedule in Regulation CC, deposits at nonproprietary ATMs must be made available for withdrawal at the start of the seventh business day after deposit.

In all cases where the federal availability schedule preempts the state schedule, only the federal exceptions will apply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule (e.g., nonlocal out-of-state checks under the temporary schedule), the state exceptions may be used to extend the state availability schedule (of six business days) to meet the federal availability schedule (of seven business days). Once the deposit is held up to the federal availability schedule limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold under any federal exception that can be applied to the deposit. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customer, in accordance with § 229.13(g) of Regulation CC. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Disclosures </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Regulation CC preempts state disclosure requirements concerning funds availability that relate to <em>accounts</em> that are inconsistent with the federal requirements. The state requriements are different from, and therefore inconsistent with, the federal disclosure rules. (§ 229.20(c)(2)). Thus, the Connecticut statute is preempted by Regulation CC to the extent that these disclosure provisions apply to <em>accounts</em> as defined by Regulation CC. The Connecticut disclosure rules would continue to apply to accounts, such as savings and time accounts, not governed by the Regulation CC disclosure requirements. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Illinois </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Board has been requested, in accordance with § 229.20(d) of Regulation CC (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-229" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 229</a>), to determine whether the Expedited Funds Availability Act and subpart B, and, in connection therewith, subpart A, of Regulation CC, preempt provisions of Illinois law relating to the availability of funds. Section 4–213(5) of the Uniform Commercial Code as adopted in Illinois (Illinois Revised Statutes Chapter 26, paragraph 4–213(5), enacted July 26, 1988) provides that: </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Time periods after which deposits must be available for withdrawal shall be determined by the provisions of the federal Expedited Funds Availability Act (Title VI of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987) and the regulations promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board for the implementation of that Act. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Section 4–213(5) of the Illinois law does not supersede Regulation CC; and, because this provision of Illinois law does not permit funds to be made available for withdrawal in a longer period of time than required under the Act and Regulation, it is not preempted by Regulation CC. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Maine </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Background </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Board has been requested, in accordance with § 229.20(d) of Regulation CC (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-229" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 229</a>), to determine whether the Expedited Funds Availability Act (the “Act”) and subpart B (and in connection therewith, subpart A) of Regulation CC, preempt the provisions of Maine law concerning the availability of funds. This preemption determination addresses the relation of the Act and Regulation CC to the Maine funds availability law. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4–213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In 1985, Maine adopted a statute governing funds availability (Title 9–B MRSA section 241(5)), which requires Maine financial institutions to make funds deposited in a transaction account, savings account, or time account available for withdrawal within a reasonable period. The Maine statute gives the Superintendent of Banking for the State of Maine the authority to promulgate rules setting forth time limitations and disclosure requirements governing funds availability. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Superintendent of Banking issued regulations implementing the Maine funds availability statute, effective July 1, 1987 (Regulation 18(IV)), and adopted amendments to this regulation, effective September 1, 1988. Under the revised regulation, funds deposited to any deposit account in a Maine financial institution must be made available for withdrawal in accordance with the Act and Regulation CC (Regulation 18–IV(A)(1)). The state regulation provides that an institution's funds availability policies for accounts subject to Regulation CC be disclosed in a manner consistent with the Regulation CC requirements. Funds availability policies for accounts not subject to Regulation CC must be disclosed in accordance with the state regulation (Regulation 18–IV(A)(2)). </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Maine law and regulation govern the availability of funds to any deposit account, as defined in the Board's Regulation D (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-204.2#p-204.2(a)" class="cfr external">12 CFR 204.2(a)</a>). This coverage is broader than the <em>accounts</em> covered in Regulation CC. The Maine law continues to apply to all deposit accounts, including those that are not accounts under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under § 229.19(e) of Regulation CC, <em>Holds on other funds,</em> the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined as <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC, in certain circumstances.) </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Availability Schedules and Disclosures </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Maine regulation incorporates the Regulation CC availability and disclosure requirements with respect to deposits to accounts covered by Regulation CC. Because the state requirements are consistent with the federal requirements, the Maine regulation is not preempted by, nor does it supersede, the federal law. </p>
<p class="hd2-paragraph">Massachusetts </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Background </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Board has been requested, in accordance with § 229.20(d) of Regulation CC (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-229" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 229</a>), to determine whether the Expedited Funds Availability Act (the “Act”) and subpart B (and in connection therewith, subpart A) of Regulation CC, preempt provisions of Massachusetts law relating to the availability of funds. This preemption determination addresses the relationship of the Act and Regulation CC to the Massachusetts funds availability law. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4–213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In 1988, Massachusetts amended its statute governing funds availability (Mass. Gen. L. ch. 167D, section 35), to require Massachusetts banking institutions to make funds available for withdrawal and disclose their availability policies in accordance with the Act and Regulation CC. The Massachusetts law, however, provides that “local originating depository institution” is to be defined as any originating depository institution located in the Commonwealth. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Massachusetts statute governs the availability of funds deposited in “any demand deposit, negotiable order of withdrawal account, savings deposit, share account or other asset account.” Regulation CC applies only to <em>accounts</em> as defined in § 229.2(a). Regulation CC does not affect the Massachusetts statute to the extent that the state law applies to deposits in savings and other accounts (including transaction accounts where the account holder is a bank, foreign bank, or the U.S. Treasury) that are not <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under § 229.19(e) of Regulation CC, <em>Holds on other funds,</em> the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined as <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC, in certain circumstances.) </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Availability Schedules </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Massachusetts definition of <em>local originating depository institution</em> (local paying bank in Regulation CC terminology) requires that in-state checks that are nonlocal checks under Regulation CC be made available in accordance with the Regulation CC local schedule. The Massachusetts law supersedes Regulation CC under the temporary and permanent schedule with respect to nonlocal checks payable by banks located in Massachusetts and deposited into <em>accounts.</em> Regulation CC preempts the Massachusetts law, however, to the extent the state law does not define banks located outside of Massachusetts, but in the same check processing region as the paying bank, as <em>local originating depository institutions.</em> </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Disclosures </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Massachusetts regulation incorporates the Regulation CC disclosure requirements with respect to both accounts covered by Regulation CC and savings and other accounts not governed by the federal regulation. Because the state requirements are consistent with the federal requirements, the Massachusetts regulation is not preempted by, nor does it supersede, the federal law. The Massachusetts disclosure rules would continue to apply to accounts not governed by the Regulation CC disclosure requirements. </p>

(See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4–213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">New Jersey does not have a law or regulation establishing the maximum time periods within which funds deposited by check or electronic payment must be made available for withdrawal. New Jersey does, however, have regulations concerning the disclosure of a banking institution's availability policy (N.J.A.C. 3:1–15.1 <em>et seq.</em>). </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Disclosures </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">New Jersey law requires every banking institution (defined as any state or federally chartered commercial bank, savings bank, or savings and loan association) to provide written disclosure to all holders of and applicants for deposit accounts which describes the institution's funds availability policy. Institutions must also disclose to their customers any significant changes to their availability policy. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Regulation CC preempts state disclosure requirements concerning funds availability that relates to <em>accounts</em> that are inconsistent with the federal requirements. The state requirements are different from, and therefore inconsistent with, the federal disclosure rules. (§ 229.20(c)(2)). Thus, the New Jersey statute (N.J.A.C. sections 3:1–15.1 <em>et seq.</em>) is preempted by Regulation CC to the extent that these disclosure provisions apply to <em>accounts</em> as defined by Regulation CC. The New Jersey disclosure rules would continue to apply to other <em>deposit accounts,</em> as defined by New Jersey law, including money market accounts and savings accounts established by a natural person for personal or family purposes, which are not governed by the Regulation CC disclosure requirements. </p>

This preemption determination addresses the relation of the Act and Regulation CC to the New York funds availability law. (See also the Board's preemption determination regarding the Uniform Commercial Code, section 4–213(5), pertaining to availability of cash deposits.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">In 1983, the New York State Banking Department, pursuant to section 14–d of the New York Banking law, issued regulations requiring that funds deposited in an account be made available for withdrawal within specified time periods, and provided certain exceptions to those availability schedules. Part 34 of the New York State Banking Department's General Regulations established time frames within which commercial banks, trust companies, and branches of foreign banks (<em>banks</em>); and savings banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions (<em>savings institutions</em>) must make funds deposited in customer accounts available for withdrawal. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Banking Department amended part 34, effective September 1, 1988, generally to exclude accounts covered by Regulation CC from the scope of the state regulation. Part 34.4 (a)(2) and (b)(2) of the revised New York rules, however, continue to apply to checks deposited to accounts, as defined in Regulation CC. These provisions require that the proceeds of nonlocal checks payable by a New York institution be made available for withdrawal not later than the start of the fourth business day following deposit, if deposited in a bank, or the fifth business day following deposit, if deposited in a savings institution. The revised regulation also provides that, with respect to savings accounts and time deposits, New York institutions could elect to comply with either the state or federal availability and disclosure requirements. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">This preemption determination supersedes the determination issued by the Board on August 18, 1988 (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/citation/53-FR-32357" class="fr-reference" data-reference="53 FR 32357">53 FR 32357</a> (August 24, 1988)). </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The New York law and regulation govern the availability of funds in savings accounts and time deposits, as well as <em>accounts</em> as defined in § 229.2(a) of Regulation CC. The New York law continues to apply to deposits to savings accounts and time deposits that are not accounts under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under § 229.19(e) of Regulation CC, <em>Hold on other funds,</em> the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined as <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC, in certain circumstances.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The New York law and regulation apply to <em>items</em> deposited to accounts. Part 34.3(e) defines <em>item</em> as <em>a check, negotiable order of withdrawal or money order deposited into an account.</em> The Board interprets the definition of <em>item</em> in New York law to be consistent with the definition of <em>check</em> in Regulation CC (§ 229.2(k)). </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Availability Schedules </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The provisions of New York law governing the availability of in-state nonlocal items provide for shorter hold than is provided under Regulation CC, and supersede that federal availability requirements.

For these deposits, the depositary bank may invoke a state exception and place a hold on the deposit up to the federal availability schedule limit for that type of deposit. Once the federal availability schedule limit is reached, the depositary bank may further extend the hold under any of the federal exceptions that apply to that deposit.

Thus, in these instances, the federal law does not preempt the state law. Rhode Island law requires commercial banks (but not thrift institutions) to make checks payable by a depositary institution that uses the same in-state clearing facility as the depositary bank available for withdrawal on the third business day following the day of the deposit. This is the same time period contained in Regulation CC for local checks payable by a bank that is a member of the same local clearinghouse as the depositary bank. (The Board views the definition of <em>the same in-state clearing facility</em> as having the same meaning as the term <em>the same check clearinghouse association</em> in the federal law's provision that allows banks to limit the customer's ability to withdraw cash on the third business day if the local check being deposited is payable by a bank that is not a member of the same local clearinghouse as the depositary bank.) Since the Rhode Island law and the federal law both require the funds to be made available no later than the third business day, the state law is not preempted by the federal law. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Rhode Island law also requires commercial banks and savings institutions to make checks payable by a depository institution located in the First or Second Federal Reserve District (outside of Rhode Island) available on the seventh business day following deposit. To the extent that this provision applies to checks payable by institutions located outside the Boston check processing region, it provides for availability in the same time as required for nonlocal checks under the temporary federal schedule, and thus is not preempted by the federal law. </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Rhode Island statute does not specify whether it applies to deposits of checks at nonproprietary ATMs. Under the temporary schedule in Regulation CC, deposits at nonproprietary ATMs must be made available for withdrawal at the opening of the seventh business day after deposit. To the extent that the Rhode Island schedules provide for shorter availability for deposits at nonproprietary ATMs, they would supersede the temporary schedule. </p>

In all cases where the federal availability schedule preempts the state schedule, only the federal exceptions will apply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule, the state exceptions may be used to extend the state availability schedule to meet the federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held up to the federal availability schedule limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold under any federal exception that can be applied to the deposit. Thus, if the state and federal availability schedules are the same for a particular deposit, both a state and a federal exception must be applicable to that deposit in order to extend the hold beyond the schedule. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customer, in accordance with § 229.13(g) of Regulation CC. </p>

Generally, checks drawn on the U.S. Treasury, the State of Wisconsin, or on a local government located in Wisconsin must be made available for withdrawal by the second day following deposit. (The law governing commercial banks determines availability based on banking day; the laws governing savings and loan associations and credit unions determine availability based on business days.) In-state and out-of-state checks must be made available for withdrawal within five days and eight days following deposit, respectively. Exceptions are provided for new accounts and reason to doubt collectibility. In addition, Wisconsin Statutes section 404.103 permits commercial banks to vary these availability requirements by agreement. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Coverage </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Wisconsin law defines <em>account,</em> with respect to the rules governing commercial banks, as <em>any account with a bank and includes a checking, time, interest or savings account</em> (Wisconsin Statutes section 404.104(1)(a)). The statutes relating to the funds availability requirements applicable to savings and loan associations and credit unions do not define the term <em>account.</em> The Federal preemption of state funds availability requirements applies only to <em>accounts</em> subject to Regulation CC, which generally consist of transaction accounts. Regulation CC does not affect the Wisconsin law to the extent that the state law applies to deposits in savings, time, and other accounts (including transaction accounts where the account holder is a bank, foreign bank, or the U.S. Treasury) that are not <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC. (Note, however, that under § 229.19(e) of Regulation CC, <em>Holds on Other Funds,</em> the federal availability schedules may apply to savings, time, and other accounts not defined as <em>accounts</em> under Regulation CC in certain circumstances.) </p>
<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">The Wisconsin statute applies to <em>items</em> deposited in accounts. This term encompasses instruments that are not defined as <em>checks</em> in Regulation CC (§ 229.2(k)), such as nonnegotiable instruments, and are therefore not subject to Regulation CC's provisions governing funds availability. Those items that are subject to Wisconsin law but are not subject to Regulation CC will continue to be covered by the state availability schedules and exceptions. </p>

This time period is shorter than the seventh business day availability required for nonlocal checks under § 229.11(c) of Regulation CC, although it is not shorter than the schedules for nonlocal checks set forth in § 229.11(c)(2) and appendix B–1 of Regulation CC. Thus, the state schedule for in-state nonlocal checks supersedes the Federal schedule to the extent that it applies to an item payable by a Wisconsin bank that is defined as a nonlocal check under Regulation CC and is not subject to reduced schedules under § 229.11(c)(2) and appendix B–1. </p>

Under the Federal law, if a state or local government check is not deposited in person to an employee of the depositary bank, but meets the other conditions set forth in § 229.10(c)(1)(iv), the funds must be made available for withdrawal not later than the second business day following deposit. The Wisconsin statute supersedes Regulation CC to the extent that the state law does not permit the use of a special deposit slip as a condition to receipt of second-day availability. </p>

The state availability law also permits commercial banks to vary the funds availability requirements by agreement (Wisconsin Statute section 404.103(1)). In all cases where the Federal schedule preempts the state schedule, only the Federal exceptions apply. For deposits that are covered by the state availability schedule (e.g., in-state nonlocal checks), a state exception must apply in order to extend the state availability schedule up to the Federal availability schedule. Once the deposit is held up to the Federal availability limit under a state exception, the depositary bank may further extend the hold only if a Federal exception can be applied to the deposit. Any time a depositary bank invokes an exception to extend a hold beyond the time periods otherwise permitted by law, it must give notice of the extended hold to its customer in accordance with § 229.13(g) of Regulation CC. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-F-to-Part-229(Business%20day%2Fbanking%20day)">
<p class="indent-1" id="p-Appendix-F-to-Part-229(Business%20day%2Fbanking%20day)" data-title="Appendix-F-to-Part-229 “Business day/banking day”" data-term="true"><em class="paragraph-hierarchy">Business day/banking day.</em>   The definitions of <em>business day</em> and <em>banking day</em> in the Wisconsin statutes are preempted by the Regulation CC definition of those terms. For determining the permissible hold under the Wisconsin schedules that supersede the Regulation CC schedule, deposits are considered available for withdrawal on the specified number of <em>business days</em> following the <em>banking day</em> of deposit. </p>
</div>
<p>Wisconsin law considers funds to be deposited, for the purpose of determining when they must be made available for withdrawal, when an item is “received at the proof and transit facility of the depository.” For the purposes of this preemption determination, funds are considered deposited under Wisconsin law in accordance with the rules set forth in § 229.19(a) of Regulation CC. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Disclosures </p>
<p>The Wisconsin statute does not require disclosure of a bank's funds availability policy. The state law does require, however, that a bank give notice to its customer if it extends the time within which funds will be available for withdrawal due to the bank's doubt as to the collectibility of the item (Wisconsin Statutes sections 404.213(4m)(b); 215.136(2); and 186.117(2)). </p>
<p>Regulation CC preempts state disclosure requirements concerning funds availability that relate to <em>accounts</em> that are inconsistent with the Federal requirements. The state requirement is different from, and therefore inconsistent with, the Federal disclosure rules (§ 229.20(c)(2)). Thus, the Wisconsin statute is preempted by Regulation CC to the extent that the state notice requirement applies to <em>accounts</em> as defined by Regulation CC. The Wisconsin requirement would continue to apply to accounts, such as savings and time accounts, not governed by the Regulation CC disclosure requirements. </p>

<div class="footnote" id="Appendix-F-to-Part-229-footnote-1"><p><sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-F-to-Part-229-footref-1">1</a>]</sup> The California regulation uses the term <em>paying bank</em> when describing the institution on which these checks are drawn, but does not define <em>paying bank</em> or <em>bank.</em> Regulation CC's definitions of <em>paying bank</em> and <em>bank</em> include savings institutions and credit unions as well as commercial banks and branches of foreign banks. However, because the California regulation makes separate provisions for checks drawn on savings institutions and credit unions, the Board concludes that the term <em>paying bank,</em> as used in the California regulation, includes only commercial banks and foreign bank branches.</p></div>
