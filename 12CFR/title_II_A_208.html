<div class="footnote" id="208.5-footnote-3"><p><sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#208.5-footref-3">3</a>]</sup> In the case of dividends in excess of net income for the year, a bank generally is not required to carry forward negative amounts resulting from such excess. Instead, the bank may attribute the excess to the prior two years, attributing the excess first to the earlier year and then to the immediately preceding year. If the excess is greater than the bank's previously undistributed net income for the preceding two years, prior Board approval of the dividend is required and a negative amount would be carried forward in future dividend calculations. However, in determining any such request for approval, the Board could consider any request for different treatment of such negative amount, including advance waivers for future periods. This applies only to earnings deficits that result from dividends declared in excess of net income for the year and does not apply to other types of current earnings deficits.</p></div>
<div class="footnote" id="208.5-footnote-4"><p><sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#208.5-footref-4">4</a>]</sup> State member banks are required to comply with state law provisions concerning the maintenance of surplus funds in addition to common capital. Where the surplus of a State member bank is less than what applicable state law requires the bank to maintain relative to its capital stock account, the bank may be required to transfer amounts from its undivided profits account to surplus.</p></div>

<h1>Appendix A to § 208.25—Sample Form of Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance
</h1>
<h3>Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance
</h3>
<p>We are giving you this notice to inform you that:
</p>
<p>The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.
</p>
<p>The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using FEMA's <em>Flood Insurance Rate Map</em> or the <em>Flood Hazard Boundary Map</em> for the following community: ______. This area has a one percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%).
</p>
<p>Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.
</p>
<p>____ The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.
</p>
<p>• At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover <em>the lesser of:</em>
</p>
<p>(1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan; <em>or</em>
</p>
<p>(2) the maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.
</p>
<p>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and not the land itself.
</p>
<p>• Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.
</p>
<p>• Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose not to maintain flood insurance on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.
</p>
<h3>Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage
</h3>
<p>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage.
</p>
<h3>[Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans
</h3>
<p>Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be used to pay the flood insurance provider.]
</p>
<p>____ Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the event of a Federally declared flood disaster.</p>
</div>
<div class="extract">
<h1>Appendix B to § 208.25—Sample Clause for Option to Escrow for Outstanding Loans
</h1>
<h3>Escrow Option Clause
</h3>
<p>You have the option to escrow all premiums and fees for the payment on your flood insurance policy that covers any residential building or mobile home that is located in an area with special flood hazards and that secures your loan. If you choose this option:
</p>
<p>• Your payments will be deposited in an escrow account to be paid to the flood insurance provider.

A bank must determine, based on the information available to it, the customer's capability to evaluate investment risk. In some cases, the bank may conclude that the customer is not capable of making independent investment decisions in general. In other cases, the institutional customer may have general capability, but may not be able to understand a particular type of instrument or its risk. This is more likely to arise with relatively new types of instruments, or those with significantly different risk or volatility characteristics than other investments generally made by the institution. If a customer is either generally not capable of evaluating investment risk or lacks sufficient capability to evaluate the particular product, the scope of a bank's customer-specific obligations under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-208.37#p-208.37(d)" class="cfr external">§ 208.37(d)</a> would not be diminished by the fact that the bank was dealing with an institutional customer.

The Board reminds state member banks of the fundamental canon of federal banking law that activities are permissible for a national bank only if authority is provided under federal law, including the National Bank Act. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="208.112(b)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>b<span class="paren">)</span></span> The Board generally believes that the same bank activity, presenting the same risks, should be subject to the same regulatory framework, regardless of which agency supervises the bank. This principle of equal treatment helps to level the competitive playing field among banks with different charters and different federal supervisors and to mitigate the risks of regulatory arbitrage. </p>

<p class="indent-1" data-title="208.112(c)"><span class="paragraph-hierarchy"><span class="paren">(</span>c<span class="paren">)</span></span> In alignment with this principle, the Board generally presumes that it will exercise its discretion under section 9(13) of the Federal Reserve Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/330" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 330</a>) to limit state member banks and their subsidiaries to engaging as principal in only those activities that are permissible for national banks—in each case, subject to the terms, conditions, and limitations placed on national banks with respect to the activity—unless those activities are permissible for state banks by federal statute or under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-362" class="cfr external">12 CFR part 362</a>. For example, if the OCC conditions permissibility on a national bank demonstrating, to the satisfaction of its supervisory office, that the bank has controls in place to conduct the activity in a safe and sound manner, and receiving a written nonobjection from OCC supervisory staff before engaging in a particular activity, then the activity would not be permissible for a state member bank unless the bank makes the same demonstration and receives a written nonobjection from Federal Reserve supervisory staff before commencing such activity. </p>

Under that provision, a state member bank may not, without the permission of the Board, change the general character of its business or the scope of the corporate powers it exercises at the time of its admission. In determining whether to grant permission to engage in an activity under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-208.3#p-208.3(d)(2)" class="cfr external">§ 208.3(d)(2)</a>, the Board will rebuttably presume that a state member bank and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging as principal in any activity that is impermissible for national banks, unless the activity is permissible for state banks under federal statute or <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/part-362" class="cfr external">part 362 of this title</a>. This presumption may be rebutted if there is a clear and compelling rationale for the Board to allow the proposed deviation in regulatory treatment among federally supervised banks, and the state member bank has robust plans for managing the risks of the proposed activity in accordance with principles of safe and sound banking.

Under appendix D–1 of this part, at a minimum, a state member bank should have in place and implement internal controls and information systems that are appropriate for the nature, scope, and risks of its activities. Further, under <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-12/section-208.3#p-208.3(d)(3)" class="cfr external">§ 208.3(d)(3)</a>, a state member bank must comply at all times with this part and conditions of membership prescribed by the Board; in addition, a state member bank must comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including those related to consumer compliance and anti-money laundering. With respect to any novel and unprecedented activities, appropriate systems to monitor and control risks, including liquidity, credit, market, operational, and compliance risks, are particularly important; Federal Reserve supervisors will expect banks to be able to explain and demonstrate an effective control environment related to such activities. </p></div>

</h4>
<p>The agencies' regulations require that each insured depository institution adopt and maintain a written policy that establishes appropriate limits and standards for all extensions of credit that are secured by liens on or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-C-to-Part-208-footnote-1" id="Appendix-C-to-Part-208-footref-1">1</a>] </sup>  These guidelines are intended to assist institutions in the formulation and maintenance of a real estate lending policy that is appropriate to the size of the institution and the nature and scope of its individual operations, as well as satisfies the requirements of the regulation. </p>

<p>Each institution's policies must be comprehensive, and consistent with safe and sound lending practices, and must ensure that the institution operates within limits and according to standards that are reviewed and approved at least annually by the board of directors. Real estate lending is an integral part of many institutions' business plans and, when undertaken in a prudent manner, will not be subject to examiner criticism. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-208">Loan Portfolio Management Considerations </p>
<p>The lending policy should contain a general outline of the scope and distribution of the institution's credit facilities and the manner in which real estate loans are made, serviced, and collected. In particular, the institution's policies on real estate lending should: </p>
<p>• Identify the geographic areas in which the institution will consider lending. </p>
<p>• Establish a loan portfolio diversification policy and set limits for real estate loans by type and geographic market (e.g., limits on higher risk loans). </p>
<p>• Identify appropriate terms and conditions by type of real estate loan. </p>
<p>• Establish loan origination and approval procedures, both generally and by size and type of loan. </p>
<p>• Establish prudent underwriting standards that are clear and measurable, including loan-to-value limits, that are consistent with these supervisory guidelines. </p>
<p>• Establish review and approval procedures for exception loans, including loans with loan-to-value percentages in excess of supervisory limits. </p>
<p>• Establish loan administration procedures, including documentation, disbursement, collateral inspection, collection, and loan review. </p>
<p>• Establish real estate appraisal and evaluation programs. </p>
<p>• Require that management monitor the loan portfolio and provide timely and adequate reports to the board of directors. </p>
<p>The institution should consider both internal and external factors in the formulation of its loan policies and strategic plan. Factors that should be considered include: </p>
<p>• The size and financial condition of the institution. </p>
<p>• The expertise and size of the lending staff. </p>
<p>• The need to avoid undue concentrations of risk. </p>
<p>• Compliance with all real estate related laws and regulations, including the Community Reinvestment Act, anti-discrimination laws, and for savings associations, the Qualified Thrift Lender test. </p>
<p>• Market conditions. </p>
<p>The institution should monitor conditions in the real estate markets in its lending area so that it can react quickly to changes in market conditions that are relevant to its lending decisions. Market supply and demand factors that should be considered include: </p>
<p>• Demographic indicators, including population and employment trends. </p>
<p>• Zoning requirements. </p>
<p>• Current and projected vacancy, construction, and absorption rates. </p>
<p>• Current and projected lease terms, rental rates, and sales prices, including concessions. </p>
<p>• Current and projected operating expenses for different types of projects. </p>
<p>• Economic indicators, including trends and diversification of the lending area. </p>
<p>• Valuation trends, including discount and direct capitalization rates. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-208">Underwriting Standards </p>
<p>Prudently underwritten real estate loans should reflect all relevant credit factors, including: </p>
<p>• The capacity of the borrower, or income from the underlying property, to adequately service the debt. </p>
<p>• The value of the mortgaged property. </p>
<p>• The overall creditworthiness of the borrower. </p>
<p>• The level of equity invested in the property. </p>
<p>• Any secondary sources of repayment. </p>
<p>• Any additional collateral or credit enhancements (such as guarantees, mortgage insurance or takeout commitments). </p>
<p>The lending policies should reflect the level of risk that is acceptable to the board of directors and provide clear and measurable underwriting standards that enable the institution's lending staff to evaluate these credit factors. The underwriting standards should address: </p>
<p>• The maximum loan amount by type of property. </p>
<p>• Maximum loan maturities by type of property. </p>
<p>• Amortization schedules. </p>
<p>• Pricing structure for different types of real estate loans. </p>
<p>• Loan-to-value limits by type of property. </p>
<p>For development and construction projects, and completed commercial properties, the policy should also establish, commensurate with the size and type of the project or property: </p>
<p>• Requirements for feasibility studies and sensitivity and risk analyses (<em>e.g.,</em> sensitivity of income projections to changes in economic variables such as interest rates, vacancy rates, or operating expenses). </p>
<p>• Minimum requirements for initial investment and maintenance of hard equity by the borrower (<em>e.g.,</em> cash or unencumbered investment in the underlying property). </p>
<p>• Minimum standards for net worth, cash flow, and debt service coverage of the borrower or underlying property. </p>
<p>• Standards for the acceptability of and limits on non-amortizing loans. </p>
<p>• Standards for the acceptability of and limits on the use of interest reserves. </p>
<p>• Pre-leasing and pre-sale requirements for income-producing property. </p>
<p>• Pre-sale and minimum unit release requirements for non-income-producing property loans. </p>
<p>• Limits on partial recourse or nonrecourse loans and requirements for guarantor support. </p>
<p>• Requirements for takeout commitments. </p>
<p>• Minimum covenants for loan agreements. </p>

<p class="table-note"><sup>1</sup> Multifamily construction includes condominiums and cooperatives.
</p>
<p class="table-note"><sup>2</sup> A loan-to-value limit has not been established for permanent mortgage or home equity loans on owner-occupied, 1- to 4-family residential property. However, for any such loan with a loan-to-value ratio that equals or exceeds 90 percent at origination, an institution should require appropriate credit enhancement in the form of either mortgage insurance or readily marketable collateral.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The supervisory loan-to-value limits should be applied to the underlying property that collateralizes the loan. For loans that fund multiple phases of the same real estate project (e.g., a loan for both land development and construction of an office building), the appropriate loan-to-value limit is the limit applicable to the final phase of the project funded by the loan; however, loan disbursements should not exceed actual development or construction outlays. In situations where a loan is fully cross-collateralized by two or more properties or is secured by a collateral pool of two or more properties, the appropriate maximum loan amount under supervisory loan-to-value limits is the sum of the value of each property, less senior liens, multiplied by the appropriate loan-to-value limit for each property. To ensure that collateral margins remain within the supervisory limits, lenders should redetermine conformity whenever collateral substitutions are made to the collateral pool. </p>
<p>In establishing internal loan-to-value limits, each lender is expected to carefully consider the institution-specific and market factors listed under “Loan Portfolio Management Considerations,” as well as any other relevant factors, such as the particular subcategory or type of loan. For any subcategory of loans that exhibits greater credit risk than the overall category, a lender should consider the establishment of an internal loan-to-value limit for that subcategory that is lower than the limit for the overall category. </p>
<p>The loan-to-value ratio is only one of several pertinent credit factors to be considered when underwriting a real estate loan. Other credit factors to be taken into account are highlighted in the “Underwriting Standards” section above. Because of these other factors, the establishment of these supervisory limits should not be interpreted to mean that loans at these levels will automatically be considered sound. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-208">Loans in Excess of the Supervisory Loan-to-Value Limits </p>
<p>The agencies recognize that appropriate loan-to-value limits vary not only among categories of real estate loans but also among individual loans. Therefore, it may be appropriate in individual cases to originate or purchase loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits, based on the support provided by other credit factors. Such loans should be identified in the institutions's records, and their aggregate amount reported at least quarterly to the institution's board of directors. (See additional reporting requirements described under “Exceptions to the General Policy.”) </p>
<p>The aggregate amount of all loans in excess of the supervisory loan-to-value limits should not exceed 100 percent of total capital.<sup>[<a class="footnote-reference" href="#Appendix-C-to-Part-208-footnote-2" id="Appendix-C-to-Part-208-footref-2">2</a>] </sup>  Moreover, within the aggregate limit, total loans for all commercial, agricultural, multifamily or other non-1-to-4 family residential properties should not exceed 30 percent of total capital. An institution will come under increased supervisory scrutiny as the total of such loans approaches these levels. </p>

<p>In determining the aggregate amount of such loans, institutions should: (a) Include all loans secured by the same property if any one of those loans exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limits; and (b) include the recourse obligation of any such loan sold with recourse. Conversely, a loan should no longer be reported to the directors as part of aggregate totals when reduction in principal or senior liens, or additional contribution of collateral or equity (e.g., improvements to the real property securing the loan), bring the loan-to-value ratio into compliance with supervisory limits. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-208">Excluded Transactions </p>
<p>The agencies also recognize that there are a number of lending situations in which other factors significantly outweigh the need to apply the supervisory loan-to-value limits. These include: </p>
<p>• Loans guaranteed or insured by the U.S. government or its agencies, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit. </p>
<p>• Loans backed by the full faith and credit of a state government, provided that the amount of the assurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit. </p>
<p>• Loans guaranteed or insured by a state, municipal or local government, or an agency thereof, provided that the amount of the guaranty or insurance is at least equal to the portion of the loan that exceeds the supervisory loan-to-value limit, and provided that the lender has determined that the guarantor or insurer has the financial capacity and willingness to perform under the terms of the guaranty or insurance agreement. </p>
<p>• Loans that are to be sold promptly after origination, without recourse, to a financially responsible third party. </p>
<p>• Loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured without the advancement of new funds or an increase in the line of credit (except for reasonable closing costs), or loans that are renewed, refinanced, or restructured in connection with a workout situation, either with or without the advancement of new funds, where consistent with safe and sound banking practices and part of a clearly defined and well-documented program to achieve orderly liquidation of the debt, reduce risk of loss, or maximize recovery on the loan. </p>
<p>• Loans that facilitate the sale of real estate acquired by the lender in the ordinary course of collecting a debt previously contracted in good faith. </p>
<p>• Loans for which a lien on or interest in real property is taken as additional collateral through an abundance of caution by the lender (e.g., the institution takes a blanket lien on all or substantially all of the assets of the borrower, and the value of the real property is low relative to the aggregate value of all other collateral). </p>
<p>• Loans, such as working capital loans, where the lender does not rely principally on real estate as security and the extension of credit is not used to acquire, develop, or construct permanent improvements on real property. </p>
<p>• Loans for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real property, but not secured by the property, if such security interest is not required by prudent underwriting practice. </p>

<div id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208">
<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-208">Exceptions to the General Lending Policy </p>
<p>Some provision should be made for the consideration of loan requests from creditworthy borrowers whose credit needs do not fit within the institution's general lending policy. An institution may provide for prudently underwritten exceptions to its lending policies, including loan-to-value limits, on a loan-by-loan basis. However, any exceptions from the supervisory loan-to-value limits should conform to the aggregate limits on such loans discussed above. </p>
<p>The board of directors is responsible for establishing standards for the review and approval of exception loans. Each institution should establish an appropriate internal process for the review and approval of loans that do not conform to its own internal policy standards. The approval of any such loan should be supported by a written justification that clearly sets forth all of the relevant credit factors that support the underwriting decision. The justification and approval documents for such loans should be maintained as a part of the permanent loan file. Each institution should monitor compliance with its real estate lending policy and individually report exception loans of a significant size to its board of directors. </p>

<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-C-to-Part-208" data-title="Appendix-C-to-Part-208">Supervisory Review of Real Estate Lending Policies and Practices </p>
<p>The real estate lending policies of institutions will be evaluated by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine if the policies are consistent with safe and sound lending practices, these guidelines, and the requirements of the regulation. In evaluating the adequacy of the institution's real estate lending policies and practices, examiners will take into consideration the following factors: </p>
<p>• The nature and scope of the institution's real estate lending activities. </p>
<p>• The size and financial condition of the institution. </p>
<p>• The quality of the institution's management and internal controls. </p>
<p>• The expertise and size of the lending and loan administration staff. </p>
<p>• Market conditions. </p>
<p>Lending policy exception reports will also be reviewed by examiners during the course of their examinations to determine whether the institutions' exceptions are adequately documented and appropriate in light of all of the relevant credit considerations. An excessive volume of exceptions to an institution's real estate lending policy may signal a weakening of its underwriting practices, or may suggest a need to revise the loan policy. </p>

<p class="indent-1 no-hierarchy">Financial institutions have an affirmative duty to protect their customers' information against unauthorized access or use. Notifying customers of a security incident involving the unauthorized access or use of the customer's information in accordance with the standard set forth below is a key part of that duty. Timely notification of customers is important to manage an institution's reputation risk. Effective notice also may reduce an institution's legal risk, assist in maintaining good customer relations, and enable the institution's customers to take steps to protect themselves against the consequences of identity theft. When customer notification is warranted, an institution may not forgo notifying its customers of an incident because the institution believes that it may be potentially embarrassed or inconvenienced by doing so. </p>

<p class="indent-2 no-hierarchy">When a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized access to sensitive customer information, the institution should conduct a reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines that misuse of its information about a customer has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should notify the affected customer as soon as possible. Customer notice may be delayed if an appropriate law enforcement agency determines that notification will interfere with a criminal investigation and provides the institution with a written request for the delay. However, the institution should notify its customers as soon as notification will no longer interfere with the investigation. </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">Under the Guidelines, an institution must protect against unauthorized access to or use of customer information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. Substantial harm or inconvenience is most likely to result from improper access to <em>sensitive customer information</em> because this type of information is most likely to be misused, as in the commission of identity theft. For purposes of this Guidance, <em>sensitive customer information</em> means a customer's name, address, or telephone number, in conjunction with the customer's social security number, driver's license number, account number, credit or debit card number, or a personal identification number or password that would permit access to the customer's account. <em>Sensitive customer information</em> also includes any combination of components of customer information that would allow someone to log onto or access the customer's account, such as user name and password or password and account number. </p>

<p class="indent-3 no-hierarchy">If a financial institution, based upon its investigation, can determine from its logs or other data precisely which customers' information has been improperly accessed, it may limit notification to those customers with regard to whom the institution determines that misuse of their information has occurred or is reasonably possible. However, there may be situations where the institution determines that a group of files has been accessed improperly, but is unable to identify which specific customers' information has been accessed. If the circumstances of the unauthorized access lead the institution to determine that misuse of the information is reasonably possible, it should notify all customers in the group. </p>
