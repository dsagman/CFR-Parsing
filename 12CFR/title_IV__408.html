Section 102(2) of NEPA contains certain procedural requirements directed toward the attainment of such goals. In particular, all Federal agencies are required to give appropriate consideration to the environmental effects of their proposed actions in their decision-making and to prepare detailed environmental statements on recommendations or reports on proposals for legislation and other major Federal Actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. </p>

Accordingly, CEQ issued final NEPA Regulations which are binding on all Federal agencies as of July 30, 1979 (<a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-40/part-1500" class="cfr external">40 CFR parts 1500</a> through <a href="/on/2023-09-28/title-40/part-1508" class="cfr external">1508</a>) on November 29, 1979. These Regulations provide that each Federal agency shall as necessary adopt implementing procedures to supplement the NEPA Regulations.

<p>Historically, virtually all financing provided by Eximbank has been in aid of U.S. exports which involve no effects on the quality of the environment within the United States, its territories or possessions. Eximbank has separate procedures for conducting environmental reviews where such reviews are required by E.O. 12114 (January 4, 1979) because of potential effects on the environment of global commons areas or on the environment of foreign nations. The procedures set forth in this part apply to the relatively rare cases where Eximbank financing of U.S. exports may affect environmental quality in the United States, its territories or possessions. </p>
