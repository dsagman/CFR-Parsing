<p class="hd1-paragraph" id="p-Appendix-A-to-Part-22" data-title="Appendix-A-to-Part-22">Notice of Special Flood Hazards and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance </p>
<p>We are giving you this notice to inform you that: </p>
<p>The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards. </p>
<p>The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using FEMA's <em>Flood Insurance Rate Map</em> or the <em>Flood Hazard Boundary Map</em> for the following community: ___. This area has a one percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%). </p>
<p>Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information. </p>
<p>__The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense. </p>
<p>• At a minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover <em>the lesser of:</em> </p>

</div>
<p>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and not the land itself. </p>
<p>• Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements. </p>
<p>• Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose not to maintain flood insurance on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage </p>
<p>Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability, cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage. </p>
<p class="hd3-paragraph">[Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans </p>
<p>Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be used to pay the flood insurance provider.] </p>
<p>__Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the event of a Federally declared flood disaster. </p>

<p class="hd3-paragraph">Escrow Option Clause </p>
<p>You have the option to escrow all premiums and fees for the payment on your flood insurance policy that covers any residential building or mobile home that is located in an area with special flood hazards and that secures your loan. If you choose this option: </p>
<p>• Your payments will be deposited in an escrow account to be paid to the flood insurance provider. </p>
<p>• The escrow amount for flood insurance will be added to the regular mortgage payment that you make to your lender or its servicer. </p>
<p>• The payments you make into the escrow account will accumulate over time and the funds will be used to pay your flood insurance policy when your lender or servicer receives a notice from your flood insurance provider that the flood insurance premium is due. </p>
