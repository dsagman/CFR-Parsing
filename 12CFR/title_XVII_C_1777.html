These provisions authorize OFHEO to administer certain capital requirements for the Enterprises, to classify the capital of the Enterprises based on capital levels specified in the 1992 Act, and, in appropriate circumstances, to exercise discretion to reclassify an Enterprise into a lower capital category. Under these provisions, there are also automatic consequences for an Enterprise that is not classified as adequately capitalized, as well as discretionary authority for OFHEO to require an Enterprise to take remedial actions. Subpart B implements the provisions of sections 1364 through 1368, 1369(b) through (e), 1369C, and 1369D of the 1992 Act as they apply to the Enterprises (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4614" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 4614</a> through <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4618" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4618</a>, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4619" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4619(b)</a> through <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4619" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(e)</a>, <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4622" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4622</a> and <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4623" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4623</a>). The principal purposes of subpart B are to identify the capital measures and capital levels that OFHEO uses in determining the capital classification of an Enterprise; to set out the procedures OFHEO uses in determining such capital classifications; to establish procedures for submission and review of capital restoration plans of an Enterprise that is not classified as adequately capitalized; and to establish procedures under which OFHEO issues orders pursuant to section 1366(b)(1) through (4) of the 1992 Act (<a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4616" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12 U.S.C. 4616(b)(1)</a> through <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/link/uscode/12/4616" class="usc external" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(4)</a>). </p>
