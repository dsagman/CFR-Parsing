["(a)Authority.This part, known as Regulation Z, is issued by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection to implement the Federal Truth in Lending Act, which is contained in title I of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1601et seq.). This part also implements title XII, section 1204 of the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100–86, 101 Stat. 552). Furthermore, this part implements certain provisions of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, as amended (12 U.S.C. 2601et seq.). In addition, this part implements certain provisions of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 3331et seq.). The Bureau's information-collection requirements contained in this part have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of44 U.S.C. 3501et seq.and have been assigned OMB No. 3170–0015 (Truth in Lending).",
 "(b)Purpose.The purpose of this part is to promote the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost, to ensure that consumers are provided with greater and more timely information on the nature and costs of the residential real estate settlement process, and to effect certain changes in the settlement process for residential real estate that will result in more effective advance disclosure to home buyers and sellers of settlement costs. The regulation also includes substantive protections. It gives consumers the right to cancel certain credit transactions that involve a lien on a consumer's principal dwelling, regulates certain credit card practices, and provides a means for fair and timely resolution of credit billing disputes. The regulation does not generally govern charges for consumer credit, except that several provisions in subpart G set forth special rules addressing certain charges applicable to credit card accounts under an open-end (not home-secured) consumer credit plan. The regulation requires a maximum interest rate to be stated in variable-rate contracts secured by the consumer's dwelling. It also imposes limitations on home-equity plans that are subject to the requirements of§ 1026.40and mortgages that are subject to the requirements of§ 1026.32. The regulation prohibits certain acts or practices in connection with credit secured by a dwelling in§ 1026.36, and credit secured by a consumer's principal dwelling in§ 1026.35. The regulation also regulates certain practices of creditors who extend private education loans as defined in§ 1026.46(b)(5). In addition, it imposes certain limitations on increases in costs for mortgage transactions subject to§ 1026.19(e)and(f).",

 '(2)With regard to a covered separate credit feature and an asset feature of a prepaid account where both are accessible by a hybrid prepaid-credit card as defined in§ 1026.61, an extension of credit that is incident to an electronic fund transfer occurs when the hybrid prepaid-credit card accesses both funds in the asset feature of the prepaid account and a credit extension from the credit feature with respect to a particular transaction.',
 '(a)General rule.The annual percentage rate is a measure of the cost of credit, expressed as a yearly rate. An annual percentage rate shall be considered accurate if it is not more than1⁄8th of 1 percentage point above or below the annual percentage rate determined in accordance with this section. An error in disclosure of the annual percentage rate or finance charge shall not, in itself, be considered a violation of this part if:',
 '(1)The error resulted from a corresponding error in a calculation tool used in good faith by the creditor; and',
 '(2)Upon discovery of the error, the creditor promptly discontinues use of that calculation tool for disclosure purposes, and notifies the Bureau in writing of the error in the calculation tool.',
 '(b)Annual percentage rate—in general.Where one or more periodic rates may be used to compute the finance charge, the annual percentage rate(s) to be disclosed for purposes of§§ 1026.60,1026.40,1026.6,1026.7(a)(4)or(b)(4),1026.9,1026.15,1026.16,1026.26,1026.55, and1026.56shall be computed by multiplying each periodic rate by the number of periods in a year.',
 "(c)Optional effective annual percentage rate for periodic statements for creditors offering open-end credit plans secured by a consumer's dwelling.A creditor offering an open-end plan subject to the requirements of§ 1026.40need not disclose an effective annual percentage rate. Such a creditor may, at its option, disclose an effective annual percentage rate(s) pursuant to§ 1026.7(a)(7)and compute the effective annual percentage rate as follows:",
 "(1)Solely periodic rates imposed.If the finance charge is determined solely by applying one or more periodic rates, at the creditor's option, either:",
 '(i)By multiplying each periodic rate by the number of periods in a year; or',
 '(ii)By dividing the total finance charge for the billing cycle by the sum of the balances to which the periodic rates were applied and multiplying the quotient (expressed as a percentage) by the number of billing cycles in a year.',
 '(2)Minimum or fixed charge, but not transaction charge, imposed.If the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a minimum, fixed, or other charge not due to the application of a periodic rate, other than a charge with respect to any specific transaction during the billing cycle, by dividing the total finance charge for the billing cycle by the amount of the balance(s) to which it is applicable and multiplying the quotient (expressed as a percentage) by the number of billing cycles in a year. If there is no balance to which the finance charge is applicable, an annual percentage rate cannot be determined under this section. Where the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a loan fee, points, or similar charge that relates to opening, renewing, or continuing an account, the amount of such charge shall not be included in the calculation of the annual percentage rate.',
 '(3)Transaction charge imposed.If the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a charge relating to a specific transaction during the billing cycle (even if the total finance charge also includes any other minimum, fixed, or other charge not due to the application of a periodic rate), by dividing the total finance charge imposed during the billing cycle by the total of all balances and other amounts on which a finance charge was imposed during the billing cycle without duplication, and multiplying the quotient (expressed as a percentage) by the number of billing cycles in a year, except that the annual percentage rate shall not be less than the largest rate determined by multiplying each periodic rate imposed during the billing cycle by the number of periods in a year. Where the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a loan fee, points, or similar charge that relates to the opening, renewing, or continuing an account, the amount of such charge shall not be included in the calculation of the annual percentage rate. See appendix F to this part regarding determination of the denominator of the fraction under this paragraph.',
 "(4)If the finance charge imposed during the billing cycle is or includes a minimum, fixed, or other charge not due to the application of a periodic rate and the total finance charge imposed during the billing cycle does not exceed 50 cents for a monthly or longer billing cycle, or the pro rata part of 50 cents for a billing cycle shorter than monthly, at the creditor's option, by multiplying each applicable periodic rate by the number of periods in a year, notwithstanding the provisions ofparagraphs (c)(2)and(c)(3)of this section.",
 '(d)Calculations where daily periodic rate applied.If the provisions ofparagraph (c)(1)(ii)or(c)(2)of this section apply and all or a portion of the finance charge is determined by the application of one or more daily periodic rates, the annual percentage rate may be determined either:',
 '(1)By dividing the total finance charge by the average of the daily balances and multiplying the quotient by the number of billing cycles in a year; or',
 '(2)By dividing the total finance charge by the sum of the daily balances and multiplying the quotient by 365.',
 "(a)Consumer's right to rescind.",
 '(1)',

 '(ii)As provided in section 125(e) of the Act, the consumer does not have the right to rescind each credit extension made under the plan if such extension is made in accordance with a previously established credit limit for the plan.',
 "(2)To exercise the right to rescind, the consumer shall notify the creditor of the rescission by mail, telegram, or other means of written communication. Notice is considered given when mailed, or when filed for telegraphic transmission, or, if sent by other means, when delivered to the creditor's designated place of business.",
 "(3)The consumer may exercise the right to rescind until midnight of the third business day following the occurrence described inparagraph (a)(1)of this section that gave rise to the right of rescission, delivery of the notice required byparagraph (b)of this section, or delivery of all material disclosures, whichever occurs last. If the required notice and material disclosures are not delivered, the right to rescind shall expire 3 years after the occurrence giving rise to the right of rescission, or upon transfer of all of the consumer's interest in the property, or upon sale of the property, whichever occurs first. In the case of certain administrative proceedings, the rescission period shall be extended in accordance with section 125(f) of the Act. The termmaterial disclosuresmeans the information that must be provided to satisfy the requirements in§ 1026.6with regard to the method of determining the finance charge and the balance upon which a finance charge will be imposed, the annual percentage rate, the amount or method of determining the amount of any membership or participation fee that may be imposed as part of the plan, and the payment information described in§ 1026.40(d)(5)(i)and(ii)that is required under§ 1026.6(e)(2).",

 "(c)Delay of creditor's performance.Unless a consumer waives the right to rescind underparagraph (e)of this section, no money shall be disbursed other than in escrow, no services shall be performed, and no materials delivered until after the rescission period has expired and the creditor is reasonably satisfied that the consumer has not rescinded. A creditor does not violate this section if a third party with no knowledge of the event activating the rescission right does not delay in providing materials or services, as long as the debt incurred for those materials or services is not secured by the property subject to rescission.",
 '(d)Effects of rescission.',
 '(1)When a consumer rescinds a transaction, the security interest giving rise to the right of rescission becomes void, and the consumer shall not be liable for any amount, including any finance charge.',

When the creditor has complied with that paragraph, the consumer shall tender the money or property to the creditor or, where the latter would be impracticable or inequitable, tender its reasonable value. At the consumer's option, tender of property may be made at the location of the property or at the consumer's residence. Tender of money must be made at the creditor's designated place of business. If the creditor does not take possession of the money or property within 20 calendar days after the consumer's tender, the consumer may keep it without further obligation.",
 '(4)The procedures outlined inparagraphs (d)(2)and(3)of this section may be modified by court order.',
 "(e)Consumer's waiver of right to rescind.The consumer may modify or waive the right to rescind if the consumer determines that the extension of credit is needed to meet a bona fide personal financial emergency. To modify or waive the right, the consumer shall give the creditor a dated written statement that describes the emergency, specifically modifies or waives the right to rescind, and bears the signature of all the consumers entitled to rescind. Printed forms for this purpose are prohibited.",
 '(f)Exempt transactions.The right to rescind does not apply to the following:',
 '(1)A residential mortgage transaction.',
 '(2)A credit plan in which a state agency is a creditor.',
 '(a)Actually available terms.If an advertisement for credit states specific credit terms, it shall state only those terms that actually are or will be arranged or offered by the creditor.',
 '(b)Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures.',
 '(1)Any term required to be disclosed under§ 1026.6(b)(3)set forth affirmatively or negatively in an advertisement for an open-end (not home-secured) credit plan triggers additional disclosures under this section. Any term required to be disclosed under§ 1026.6(a)(1)or(a)(2)set forth affirmatively or negatively in an advertisement for a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of§ 1026.40triggers additional disclosures under this section. If any of the terms that trigger additional disclosures under this paragraph is set forth in an advertisement, the advertisement shall also clearly and conspicuously set forth the following:',
 '(i)Any minimum, fixed, transaction, activity or similar charge that is a finance charge under§ 1026.4that could be imposed.',
 '(ii)Any periodic rate that may be applied expressed as an annual percentage rate as determined under§ 1026.14(b). If the plan provides for a variable periodic rate, that fact shall be disclosed.',
 '(iii)Any membership or participation fee that could be imposed.',
 '(2)If an advertisement for credit to finance the purchase of goods or services specified in the advertisement states a periodic payment amount, the advertisement shall also state the total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation, assuming that the consumer pays only the periodic payment amount advertised. The disclosure of the total of payments and the time period to repay the obligation must be equally prominent to the statement of the periodic payment amount.',
 '(c)Catalogs or other multiple-page advertisements; electronic advertisements.',
 '(1)If a catalog or other multiple-page advertisement, or an electronic advertisement (such as an advertisement appearing on an Internet Web site), gives information in a table or schedule in sufficient detail to permit determination of the disclosures required byparagraph (b)of this section, it shall be considered a single advertisement if:',
 '(i)The table or schedule is clearly and conspicuously set forth; and',
 '(ii)Any statement of terms set forth in§ 1026.6appearing anywhere else in the catalog or advertisement clearly refers to the page or location where the table or schedule begins.',

 '(d)Additional requirements for home-equity plans—',
 '(1)Advertisement of terms that require additional disclosures.If any of the terms required to be disclosed under§ 1026.6(a)(1)or(a)(2)or the payment terms of the plan are set forth, affirmatively or negatively, in an advertisement for a home-equity plan subject to the requirements of§ 1026.40, the advertisement also shall clearly and conspicuously set forth the following:',
 '(i)Any loan fee that is a percentage of the credit limit under the plan and an estimate of any other fees imposed for opening the plan, stated as a single dollar amount or a reasonable range.',
 '(ii)Any periodic rate used to compute the finance charge, expressed as an annual percentage rate as determined under§ 1026.14(b).',
 '(iii)The maximum annual percentage rate that may be imposed in a variable-rate plan.',

 '(i)The period of time such initial rate will be in effect; and',
 '(ii)A reasonably current annual percentage rate that would have been in effect using the index and margin.',
 '(3)Balloon payment.If an advertisement contains a statement of any minimum periodic payment and a balloon payment may result if only the minimum periodic payments are made, even if such a payment is uncertain or unlikely, the advertisement also shall state with equal prominence and in close proximity to the minimum periodic payment statement that a balloon payment may result, if applicable. A balloon payment results if paying the minimum periodic payments does not fully amortize the outstanding balance by a specified date or time, and the consumer is required to repay the entire outstanding balance at such time. If a balloon payment will occur when the consumer makes only the minimum payments required under the plan, an advertisement for such a program which contains any statement of any minimum periodic payment shall also state with equal prominence and in close proximity to the minimum periodic payment statement:',
 '(i)That a balloon payment will result; and',
 '(ii)The amount and timing of the balloon payment that will result if the consumer makes only the minimum payments for the maximum period of time that the consumer is permitted to make such payments.',
 "(4)Tax implications.An advertisement that states that any interest expense incurred under the home-equity plan is or may be tax deductible may not be misleading in this regard. If an advertisement distributed in paper form or through the Internet (rather than by radio or television) is for a home-equity plan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, and the advertisement states that the advertised extension of credit may exceed the fair market value of the dwelling, the advertisement shall clearly and conspicuously state that:",
 '(i)The interest on the portion of the credit extension that is greater than the fair market value of the dwelling is not tax deductible for Federal income tax purposes; and',
 '(ii)The consumer should consult a tax adviser for further information regarding the deductibility of interest and charges.',
 '(5)Misleading terms.An advertisement may not refer to a home-equity plan as “free money” or contain a similarly misleading term.',
 '(6)Promotional rates and payments.',
 '(i)Definitions.The following definitions apply for purposes ofparagraph (d)(6)of this section:',
 '(A)Promotional rate.The term “promotional rate” means, in a variable-rate plan, any annual percentage rate that is not based on the index and margin that will be used to make rate adjustments under the plan, if that rate is less than a reasonably current annual percentage rate that would be in effect under the index and margin that will be used to make rate adjustments under the plan.',
 '(B)Promotional payment.The term “promotional payment” means:',
 '(1)For a variable-rate plan, any minimum payment applicable for a promotional period that:',
 '(i)Is not derived by applying the index and margin to the outstanding balance when such index and margin will be used to determine other minimum payments under the plan; and',
 '(ii)Is less than other minimum payments under the plan derived by applying a reasonably current index and margin that will be used to determine the amount of such payments, given an assumed balance.',
 '(2)For a plan other than a variable-rate plan, any minimum payment applicable for a promotional period if that payment is less than other payments required under the plan given an assumed balance.',
 '(C)Promotional period.A “promotional period” means a period of time, less than the full term of the loan, that the promotional rate or promotional payment may be applicable.',

 '(iii)Envelope excluded.The requirements inparagraph (d)(6)(ii)of this section do not apply to an envelope in which an application or solicitation is mailed, or to a banner advertisement or pop-up advertisement linked to an application or solicitation provided electronically.',
 '(e)Alternative disclosures—television or radio advertisements.An advertisement made through television or radio stating any of the terms requiring additional disclosures underparagraphs (b)(1)or(d)(1)of this section may alternatively comply withparagraphs (b)(1)or(d)(1)of this section by stating the information required byparagraphs (b)(1)(ii)or(d)(1)(ii)of this section, as applicable, and listing a toll-free telephone number, or any telephone number that allows a consumer to reverse the phone charges when calling for information, along with a reference that such number may be used by consumers to obtain the additional cost information.',
 '(f)Misleading terms.An advertisement may not refer to an annual percentage rate as “fixed,” or use a similar term, unless the advertisement also specifies a time period that the rate will be fixed and the rate will not increase during that period, or if no such time period is provided, the rate will not increase while the plan is open.',
 '(g)Promotional rates and fees—',
 '(1)Scope.The requirements of this paragraph apply to any advertisement of an open-end (not home-secured) plan, including promotional materials accompanying applications or solicitations subject to§ 1026.60(c)or accompanying applications or solicitations subject to§ 1026.60(e).',

 '(iii)The fee that will apply after the end of the promotional period.',
 '(5)Envelope excluded.The requirements inparagraph (g)(4)of this section do not apply to an envelope or other enclosure in which an application or solicitation is mailed, or to a banner advertisement or pop-up advertisement, linked to an application or solicitation provided electronically.',
 '(h)Deferred interest or similar offers—',
 '(1)Scope.The requirements of this paragraph apply to any advertisement of an open-end credit plan not subject to§ 1026.40, including promotional materials accompanying applications or solicitations subject to§ 1026.60(c)or accompanying applications or solicitations subject to§ 1026.60(e).',
 '(2)Definitions.“Deferred interest” means finance charges, accrued on balances or transactions, that a consumer is not obligated to pay or that will be waived or refunded to a consumer if those balances or transactions are paid in full by a specified date. The maximum period from the date the consumer becomes obligated for the balance or transaction until the specified date by which the consumer must pay the balance or transaction in full in order to avoid finance charges, or receive a waiver or refund of finance charges, is the “deferred interest period.” “Deferred interest” does not include any finance charges the consumer avoids paying in connection with any recurring grace period.',

The disclosures shall be grouped together, shall be segregated from everything else, and shall not contain any information not directly related to the disclosures required under§ 1026.18,§ 1026.20(c)and(d), or§ 1026.47. The disclosures required by§ 1026.20(d)shall be provided as a separate document from all other written materials.

 '(3)The creditor may disregard the effects of the following in making calculations and disclosures.',
 '(i)That payments must be collected in whole cents.',
 '(ii)That dates of scheduled payments and advances may be changed because the scheduled date is not a business day.',
 '(iii)That months have different numbers of days.',
 '(iv)The occurrence of leap year.',

 '(5)If an obligation is payable on demand, the creditor shall make the disclosures based on an assumed maturity of 1 year. If an alternate maturity date is stated in the legal obligation between the parties, the disclosures shall be based on that date.',
 '(6)',
 '(i)A series of advances under an agreement to extend credit up to a certain amount may be considered as one transaction.',
 '(ii)When a multiple-advance loan to finance the construction of a dwelling may be permanently financed by the same creditor, the construction phase and the permanent phase may be treated as either one transaction or more than one transaction.',
 '(d)Multiple creditors; multiple consumers.If a transaction involves more than one creditor, only one set of disclosures shall be given and the creditors shall agree among themselves which creditor must comply with the requirements that this part imposes on any or all of them. If there is more than one consumer, the disclosures may be made to any consumer who is primarily liable on the obligation. If the transaction is rescindable under§ 1026.23, however, the disclosures shall be made to each consumer who has the right to rescind.',
